Vulnerability Due to Interconnectivity

At a first glance the two satellite images of Image 1.1 are indistinguishable, showing lights
shining brightly in highly populated areas and dark spaces that mark vast uninhabited forests
and oceans. Yet, upon closer inspection we notice differences: Toronto, Detroit, Cleveland,
Columbus and Long Island, bright and shining in (a), have have gone dark in (b). This is not a
doctored shot from the next Armageddon movie but represents a real image of the US Northeast
on August 14, 2003, before and after the blackout that left without power an estimated 45
million people in eight US states and another 10 million in Ontario.

2003 North American Blackout
• Satellite image on Northeast United States on August 13th, 2003,at 9:29pm (EDT), 20 hours before the
2003 blackout.
• The same as above, but 5 hours after the blackout.

The 2003 blackout is a typical example of a cascading failure. When a network acts as a
transportation system, a local failure shifts loads to other nodes. If the extra load is negligible,
the system can seamlessly absorb it, and the failure goes unnoticed. If, however, the extra load
is too much for the neighboring nodes, they will too tip and redistribute the load to their
neighbors. In no time, we are faced with a cascading event, whose magnitude depends on the
position and the capacity of the nodes that failed initially.

Cascading failures have been observed in many complex systems. They take place on the
Internet, when traffic is rerouted to bypass malfunctioning routers. This routine operation can

overwhelming them with traffic. We witness cascading events in financial systems, like in 1997,
by Albert-László Barabási
when the International Monetary Fund pressured the central banks of several Pacific nations to
limit their credit, which defaulted multiple corporations, eventually resulting in stock market
crashes worldwide. The 2009-2011 financial meltdown is often seen as a classic example of a
cascading failure, the US credit crisis paralyzing the economy of the globe, leaving behind scores
of failed banks, corporations, and even bankrupt states. Cascading failures can be also induced
artificially. An example is the worldwide effort to dry up the money supply of terrorist
organizations, aimed at crippling their ability to function. Similarly, cancer researchers aim to
induce cascading failures in our cells to kill cancer cells.

The Northeast blackout illustrates several important themes of this book: First, to avoid
damaging cascades, we must understand the structure of the network on which the cascade
propagates. Second, we must be able to model the dynamical processes taking place on these
networks, like the flow of electricity. Finally, we need to uncover how the interplay between the
network structure and dynamics affects the robustness of the whole system. Although cascading
failures may appear random and unpredictable, they follow reproducible laws that can be
quantified and even predicted using the tools of network science.

The blackout also illustrates a bigger theme: vulnerability due to interconnectivity. Indeed, in the
early years of electric power each city had its own generators and electric network. Electricity
cannot be stored, however: Once produced, electricity must be immediately consumed. It made
economic sense, therefore, to link neighboring cities up, allowing them to share the extra
production and borrow electricity if needed. We owe the low price of electricity today to the
power grid, the network that emerged through these pairwise connections, linking all producers
and consumers into a single network. It allows cheaply produced power to be instantly
transported anywhere. Electricity hence offers a wonderful example of the huge positive impact
networks have on our life.

Being part of a network has its catch, however: local failures, like the breaking of a fuse
somewhere in Ohio, may not stay local any longer. Their impact can travel along the network’s
links and affect other nodes, consumers and individuals apparently removed from the original
problem. In general interconnectivity induces a remarkable non-locality: It allows information,
memes, business practices, power, energy, and viruses to spread on their respective social or
technological networks, reaching us, no matter our distance from the source. Hence networks
carry both benefits and vulnerabilities. Uncovering the factors that can enhance the spread of
traits deemed positive, and limit others that make networks weak or vulnerable, is one of the
goals of this book.

“I think the next century will be the century of complexity.”

  

We are surrounded by systems that are hopelessly complicated. Consider for example the
society that requires cooperation between billions of individuals, or communications
infrastructures that integrate billions of cell phones with computers and satellites. Our ability to
reason and comprehend our world requires the coherent activity of billions of neurons in our
brain. Our biological existence is rooted in seamless interactions between thousands of genes
and metabolites within our cells.

These systems are collectively called complex systems, capturing the fact that it is difficult to
derive their collective behavior from a knowledge of the system’s components. Given the
important role complex systems play in our daily life, in science and in economy, their
understanding, mathematical description, prediction, and eventually control is one of the major
intellectual and scientific challenges of the 21st century.

Box 1.1

Complex

The emergence of network science at the dawn of the 21st century is a vivid demonstration that
science can live up to this challenge. Indeed, behind each complex system there is an intricate
network that encodes the interactions between the system’s components:

•  The network encoding the interactions between genes, proteins, and metabolites integrates
these components into live cells. The very existence of this cellular network is a prerequisite of
life.
•  The wiring diagram capturing the connections between neurons, called the neural network,
holds the key to our understanding of how the brain functions and to our consciousness.

Networks are also at the heart of some of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st
century, empowering everything from Google to Facebook, CISCO, and Twitter. At the end,
networks permeate science, technology, business and nature to a much higher degree than it
may be evident upon a casual inspection. Consequently, we will never understand complex systems
unless we develop a deep understanding of the networks behind them.

The exploding interest in network science during the first decade of the 21st century is rooted in
the discovery that despite the obvious diversity of complex systems, the structure and the
evolution of the networks behind each system is driven by a common set of fundamental laws
and principles. Therefore, notwithstanding the amazing differences in form, size, nature, age,
and scope of real networks, most networks are driven by common organizing principles. Once
we disregard the nature of the components and the precise nature of the interactions between
them, the obtained networks are more similar than different from each other. In the following
sections we discuss the forces that have led to the emergence of this new research field and its
impact on science, technology, and society.

Two Forces Helped the Emergence of Network Science

Network science is a new discipline. One may debate its precise beginning, but by all accounts
the field has emerged as a separate discipline only in the 21st century.

Why didn’t we have network science two hundred years earlier? After all many of the networks
that the field explores are by no means new: metabolic networks date back to the origins of life,

with a history of four billion years, and the social network is as old as humanity. Furthermore,
Network Science
many disciplines, from biochemistry to sociology and brain science, have been dealing with
by Albert-László Barabási
their own networks for decades. Graph theory, a prolific subfield of mathematics, has explored
graphs since 1735. Is there a reason, therefore, to call network science the science of the 21st
century?

  

Something special happened at the dawn of the 21st century that transcended individual
research fields and catalyzed the emergence of a new discipline (Image 1.3). To understand why
this happened now and not two hundred years earlier, we need to discuss the two forces that
have contributed to the emergence of network science.

Image 1.3
The Emergence of Network Science
While the study of networks has a long history, with roots in graph theory and sociology, the modern
chapter of network science emerged only during the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century.
The explosive interest in networks is well documented by the citation pattern of two classic papers, the
1959 paper by Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi that marks the beginning of the study of random networks in
graph theory [2] and the 1973 paper by Mark Granovetter, the most cited social network paper [3]. The
ﬁgure shows the yearly citations each paper acquired since their publication. Both papers were highly
regarded within their discipline, but had only limited impact outside their ﬁeld. The explosive growth of
citations to these papers in the 21st century is a consequence of the emergence of network science,
drawing a new, interdisciplinary attention to these classic publications.

The Emergence of Network Maps
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
To describe the detailed behavior of a system consisting of hundreds to billions of interacting
components, we need a map of the system’s wiring diagram. In a social system this would
require an accurate list of your friends, your friends’ friends, and so on. In the WWW this map
tells us which webpages link to each other. In the cell the map corresponds to a detailed list of
binding interactions and chemical reactions involving genes, proteins, and metabolites.

  

In the past, we lacked the tools to map these networks. It was equally difficult to keep track of
the huge amount of data behind them. The Internet revolution, offering effective and fast data
sharing methods and cheap digital storage, fundamentally changed our ability to collect,
assemble, share, and analyze data pertaining to real networks.

Thanks to these technological advances, at the turn of the millenium we witnessed an explosion
of map making (BOX 1.2). Examples range from the CAIDA or DIMES projects that offered the
first large-scale maps of the Internet; to the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by biologists
to experimentally map out protein-protein interactions in human cells; the efforts made by
social network companies, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, to develop accurate depositories
of our friendships and professional ties; the Connectome project of the US National Institute of
Health that aims to systematically trace the neural connections in mammalian brains. The
sudden availability of these maps at the end of the 20th century has catalyzed the emergence of
network science.

The Universality of Network Characteristics

It is easy to list the differences between the various networks we encounter in nature or society:
the nodes of the metabolic network are tiny molecules and the links are chemical reactions
governed by the laws of chemistry and quantum mechanics; the nodes of the WWW are web
documents and the links are URLs guaranteed by computer algorithms; the nodes of the social
network are individuals and the links represent family, professional, friendship, and
acquaintance ties.

The processes that generated these networks also differ greatly: metabolic networks were
shaped by billions of years of evolution; the WWW is built by the collective actions of millions of
individuals and organizations; social networks are shaped by social norms whose roots go back
thousands of years. Given this diversity in size, nature, scope, history, and evolution, one would
not be surprised if the networks behind these systems would differ greatly.

A key discovery of network science is that the architecture of networks emerging in various domains
of science, nature, and technology are similar to each other, a consequence of being governed by the same
organizing principles. Consequently we can use a common set of mathematical tools to explore these
systems.

specific network properties, but each time we ask how widely they apply. We will also aim to

understand their origins, uncovering the laws that shape network evolution and their
consequences on network behavior.

  

In summary, while many disciplines have made the important contributions to network science,
the emergence of a new field was partly made possible by data availability, offering accurate
maps of networks encountered in different disciplines. These diverse maps allowed network
scientists to identify the universal properties of various network characteristics. This
universality offers the foundation of the new discipline of network science.

Box 1.2

The Origins of Network Maps

A few of the maps studied today by network scientists were generated with the purpose of
studying networks. Most are the byproduct of other projects and morphed into maps only
in the hands of network scientists.

•  The list of chemical reactions in a cell were discovered one-byone over a 150 year period
by biochemists. In the 1990s they were collected in central databases, offering the first
chance to assemble the biochemical networks within a cell.
•  The list of actors that play in each movie were traditionally scattered in newspapers,
books and encyclopedias. With the advent of the Internet, these data were assembled into
central databases, like imdb.com, feeding the curiosity of movie aficionados. The
database allowed network scientists to reconstruct the affiliation network behind
Hollywood.
•  The list of authors of millions of research papers were traditionally scattered in the
table of content of thousands of journals. Recently Web of Science, Google Scholar, and
other services have assembled them into comprehensive databases, allowing network
scientists to reconstruct accurate maps of scientific collaboration networks.

Much of the early history of network science relied on the investigators’ ingenuity to
recognize and extract networks from preexisting databases. Network science changed
that: Today well-funded research collaborations focus on map making, capturing accurate
wiring diagrams of biological, communication and social systems.

Interdisciplinary Nature

Network science offers a language through which different disciplines can seamlessly interact
with each other. Indeed, cell biologists, brain scientists (Image 1.4) and computer scientists
alike are faced with the task of characterizing the wiring diagram behind their system,
extracting information from incomplete and noisy datasets, and understanding their systems’
robustness to failures or attacks.

To be sure, each discipline brings a different set of goals, technical details and challenges, which
are important on their own. Yet, the common nature of many issues these fields struggle with
has led to a cross-disciplinary fertilization of tools and ideas. For example, the concept of
betweenness centrality that emerged in the social network literature in the 1970s, today plays a
key role in identifying high traffic nodes on the Internet. Similarly algorithms developed by
computer scientists for graph partitioning have found novel applications in identifying disease
modules in medicine or detecting communities within large social networks.

Empirical, Data Driven Nature

Several key concepts of network science have their roots in graph theory, a fertile field of
mathematics. What distinguishes network science from graph theory is its empirical nature, i.e.
its focus on data, function and utility. As we will see in the coming chapters, in network science
we are never satisfied with developing abstract mathematical tools to describe a certain network
property. Each tool we develop is tested on real data and its value is judged by the insights it
offers about a system’s properties and behavior.

Quantitative and Mathematical Nature

To contribute to the development of network science and to properly use its tools, it is essential
to master the mathematical formalism behind it. Network science borrowed the formalism to
deal with graphs from graph theory and the conceptual framework to deal with randomness and
seek universal organizing principles from statistical physics. Lately, the field is benefiting from
concepts borrowed from engineering, like control and information theory, allowing us to
understand the control principles of networks, and from statistics, helping us extract
information from incomplete and noisy datasets.

The development of network analysis software has made the tools of network science available
to a wider community, even those who may not be familiar with the intellectual foundations and
the full mathematical depths of the discipline. Yet, to further the field and to efficiently use its
tools, we neet to master its theoretical formalism.

Computational Nature

Given the size of many of the networks of practical interest, and the exceptional amount of
auxiliary data behind them, network scientists are regularly confronted by a series of formidable
computational challenges. Hence, the field has a strong computational character, actively
borrowing from algorithms, database management and data mining. A series of software tools
are available to address these computational problems, enabling practitioners with diverse
computational skills to analyze the networks of interest to them.

In summary, a mastery of network science requires familiarity with each of these aspects of the
field. It is their combination that offers the multi-faceted tools and perspectives necessary to
understand the properties of real networks.

Societal Impact

  

The impact of a new research field is measured both by its intellectual achievements as well as
by its societal impact, indicated by the reach and the potential of its applications. While network
science is a young field, its impact is everywhere.

Economic Impact: From Web Search to Social Networking

The most successful companies of the 21st century, from Google to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
Cisco, Apple and Akamai, base their technology and business model on networks. Indeed,
Google not only runs the biggest network mapping operation that humanity has ever built,
generating a comprehensive and constantly updated map of the WWW, but its search
technology is deeply interlinked with the network characteristics of the Web.

Networks have gained particular popularity with the emergence of Facebook, the company with
the ambition to map out the social network of the whole planet. Facebook was not the first
social networking site and it is likely not the last either: An impressive ecosystem of social
networking tools, from Twitter to LinkedIn are fighting for the attention of millions of users.
Algorithms conceived by network scientists fuel these sites, aiding everything from friend
recommendation to advertising.

Health: From Drug Design to Metabolic Engineering

Completed in 2001, the human genome project offered the first comprehensive list of all human
genes [5, 6]. Yet, to fully understand how our cells function, and the origin of disease, a full list
of genes is not sufficient: We also need an accurate map of how genes, proteins, metabolites and
other cellular components interact with each other. Indeed, most cellular processes, from food
processing to sensing changes in the environment, rely on molecular networks. The breakdown
of these networks is responsible for human diseases.

The increasing awareness of the importance of molecular networks has led to the emergence of
network biology, a new subfield of biology that aims to understand the behavior of cellular
networks. A parallel movement within medicine, called network medicine, aims to uncover the
role of networks in human disease (Image 1.5). The importance of these advances is illustrated
by the fact that Harvard University in 2012 started the Division of Network Medicine, that
employs researchers and medical doctors who apply network-based ideas towards
understanding human disease.

Networks play a particularly important role in drug development. The ultimate goal of network
pharmacology [7] is to develop drugs that can cure diseases without significant side effects. This

Given the numerous potential military applications, it is perhaps not surprising that one of the
first academic programs in network science was started at West Point, the US Army Military
Academy. Furthermore, starting in 2009 the Army Research Lab devoted over $300 million to
support network science centers across the US.

The knowledge and the capabilities offered by networks can be also abused. Such misuses were
well illustrated by the indiscriminate network mapping operation by the National Security
Agency [12]. Under the pretext of stopping future terrorist attacks, NSA monitored the
communications of hundreds of millions of individuals, from the US and abroad, rebuilding
their social network. With that network scientists have awoken to a new social responsibility: to

Epidemics: from Forecasting to Halting Deadly Viruses

While the H1N1 pandemic was not as devastating as it was feared at the beginning of the
outbreak in 2009, it gained a special role in the history of epidemics: It was the first pandemic
whose course and time evolution was accurately predicted months before the pandemic reached
its peak (Video 1.1) [13]. This was possible thanks to fundamental advances in understanding the
role of transportation networks in the spread of viruses.

Before 2000 epidemic modeling was dominated by compartment-based models, assuming that
everyone can infect everyone else in the same socio-physical compartment. The emergence of a
network-based framework has brought a fundamental change, offering a new level of
predictability. Today epidemic prediction is one of the most active applications of network
science [13, 14], being used to foresee the spread of influenza or to contain Ebola. It is also the
source several fundamental results covered in this book, allowing us to model and predict the
spread of biological, digital and social viruses (memes).

The impact of these advances are felt beyond epidemiology. Indeed, in January 2010 network
science tools have predicted the conditions necessary for the emergence of viruses spreading
through mobile phones [15]. The first major mobile epidemic outbreak that started in the fall of
2010 in China, infecting over 300,000 phones each day, closely followed the predicted scenario.

Neuroscience: Mapping the Brain

The human brain, consisting of hundreds of billions of interlinked neurons, is one of the least
understood networks from the perspective of network science. The reason is simple: We lack
maps telling us which neurons are linked together. The only fully mapped brain available for
research is that of the C. elegans worm, consisting of only 302 neurons. Detailed maps of
mammalian brains could lead to a revolution in brain science, allowing the understanding and
curing of numerous neurological and brain diseases. With that brain research could turn it into
one of the most prolific application area of network science [16]. Driven by the potential
transformative impact of such maps, in 2010 the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. has
initiated the Connectome project, aimed at developing technologies that could provide accurate
neuron-level maps of mammalian brains (Image 1.4).

Scientific Impact

Nowhere is the impact of network science more evident than in the scientific community. The
most prominent scientific journals, from Nature to Science, Cell and PNAS, have devoted reviews
and editorials addressing the impact of networks on various topics, from biology to social
sciences. For example, Science has published a special issue on networks, marking the ten-year
anniversary of the discovery of scale-free networks [18] (Image 1.8).

To see the impact of networks on the scientific community it is useful to inspect the citation
patterns of the most cited papers in the area of complex systems. Each of these papers are
citation classics, reporting classic discoveries like the butterfly effect, renormalisation group,
spin glasses, fractals and neural networks, and cumulatively amassing anywhere between 2,000
and 5,000 citations. To see how the interest in network science compares to the impact of these
foundational papers in Image 1.9 we compare their citation patterns to the citations of the two
most cited network science papers: the 1998 paper on small-world phenomena [19] and the 1999
Science paper reporting the discovery of scale-free networks [18]. As one can see, the rapid rise
of yearly citations to these two papers is without precedent in the area of complex systems.

Barabási and Albert, reporting the discovery of scale-free networks. [18, 19].

Several other metrics indicate that network science is impacting in a defining manner numerous
disciplines. For example, in several research fields network papers became the most cited
papers in their leading journals:

•  The 1998 paper by Watts and Strogatz in Nature on small world phenomena [19] and the 1999
paper by Barabási and Albert in Science on scale-free networks [18] were identified by
Thompson-Reuters as being among the top ten most cited papers in physical sciences during
the decade after their publication. Currently (2011) the Watts-Strogatz paper is the second most
cited of all papers published in Nature in 1998 and the Barabási-Albert paper is the most cited
paper among all papers published in Science in 1999.
•  Four years after its publication the SIAM review by Mark Newman on network science became
the most cited paper of any journal published by the Society of Industrial & Applied
Mathematics [27].
•  Reviews of Modern Physics, published since 1929, is the physics journal with the highest impact
factor. Until 2012 the most cited paper of the journal was written by Nobel Prize winner
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, his classic 1944 review entitled Stochastic Problems in Physics and
Astronomy [28]. During the 70 years since its publication, the paper gathered over 5,000
citations. Yet, in 2012 it was taken over by the first review of network science published in 2001
entitled Statistical Mechanics of Complex Networks [29].
•  The paper reporting the discovery that in scale-free networks the epidemic threshold
vanishes, by Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [30], is the most cited paper among the papers
published in 2001 by Physical Review Letters, shared with a paper on quantum computing.
•  The paper by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman on community discovery in networks [31] is
the most cited paper published in 2002 by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
•  The 2004 review entitled Network Biology [8] is the second most cited paper in the history of
Nature Reviews Genetics, the top review journal in genetics.

Prompted by this extraordinary enthusiasm within by the scientific community, network
science was examined by the National Research Council (NRC), the arm of the US National
Academies in charge of offering policy recommendation to the US government. NRC has
assembled two panels, resulting in recommendations summarized in two NRC Reports [32, 33],
defining the field of network science (Image 1.10). These reports not only documented the
emergence of a new research field, but highlighted the field’s role for science, national
competitiveness and security. Following these reports, the National Science Foundation (NSF) in
the US established a network science directorate and several Network Science Centers were
funded at US universities by the Army Research Labs.

The Rise of Networks
The frequency of use of the words evolution, quantum, and networks in books since 1880. The plot
indicates the exploding societal awareness of networks in the last decades of the 20th century, laying
the ground for the emergence of network science. The plots were generated by Google’s ngram
platform, calculating the fraction of books published in a year that mention evolution, quantum or
networks.

While the emergence of network science may appear to have been rather sudden phenomenon
(Images 1.3 & 1.9), the field was responding to a wider social awareness of the role and
importance of networks. This is illustrated in Image 1.12, that shows the usage frequency of
words that capture two important scientific revolutions of the past two centuries: evolution, the
most common term referring to Darwin’s theory of evolution, and quantum, the most frequently
used term when one refers to quantum mechanics. As expected, the use of evolution increases
after the 1859 publication of Darwin’s On the Origins of Species. The word quantum, first used in
1902, remained virtually absent until the 1920s, when quantum mechanics gained acceptance
among physicists and reached public conciousness.

The figure compares these words with the usage of network, which enjoyed a spectacular
increase following the 1980s, surpassing both evolution and quantum. While the term network has
many uses (as do evolution and quantum), its dramatic rise captures the increasing societal

intellectual core and body of knowledge, but they are also enabling platforms. Indeed, the
current revolution in genetics is built on evolutionary theory and quantum mechanics offers a

Section 2.1

The Bridges of Königsberg

Few research fields can trace their birth to a single moment and place in history. Graph theory,
the mathematical scaffold behind network science, can. Its roots go back to 1735 in Königsberg,
the capital of Eastern Prussia, a thriving merchant city of its time. The trade supported by its
busy fleet of ships allowed city officials to build seven bridges across the river Pregel that
surrounded the town. Five of these connected to the mainland the elegant island Kneiphof,
caught between the two branches of the Pregel. The remaining two crossed the two branches of
the river (Image 2.1). This peculiar arrangement gave birth to a contemporary puzzle: Can one
walk across all seven bridges and never cross the same one twice? Despite many attempts, no
one could find such path. The problem remained unsolved until 1735, when Leonard Euler, a
Swiss born mathematician, offered a rigorous mathematical proof that such path does not exist
[6, 7].

Euler represented each of the four land areas separated by the river with letters A, B, C, and D
(Image 2.1). Next he connected with lines each piece of land that had a bridge between them. He
thus built a graph, whose nodes were pieces of land and links were the bridges. Then Euler made
a simple observation: if there is a path crossing all bridges, but never the same bridge twice,
then nodes with odd number of links must be either the starting or the end point of this path.
Indeed, if you arrive to a node with an odd number of links, you may find yourself having no
unused link for you to leave it.

• Euler constructed a graph that has four nodes (A, B, C, D), each corresponding to a patch of land, and
Network Science
seven links, each corresponding to a bridge. He then showed that there is no continuous path that
by Albert-László Barabási
would cross the seven bridges while never crossing the same bridge twice. The people of Königsberg
gave up their fruitless search and in 1875 built a new bridge between B and C, increasing the number of
links of these two nodes to four. Now only one node was left with an odd number of links. Consequently
we should be able to ﬁnd the desired path. Can you ﬁnd one yourself?

  

A walking path that goes through all bridges can have only one starting and one end point. Thus
such a path cannot exist on a graph that has more than two nodes with an odd number of links.
The Königsberg graph had four nodes with an odd number of links, A, B, C, and D, so no path
could satisfy the problem.

Euler’s proof was the first time someone solved a mathematical problem using a graph. For us
the proof has two important messages: The first is that some problems become simpler and
more tractable if they are represented as a graph. The second is that the existence of the path
does not depend on our ingenuity to find it. Rather, it is a property of the graph. Indeed, given
the structure of the Königsberg graph, no matter how smart we are, we will never find the
desired path. In other words, networks have properties encoded in their structure that limit or
enhance their behavior.

To understand the many ways networks can affect the properties of a system, we need to
become familiar with graph theory, a branch of mathematics that grew out of Euler’s proof. In
this chapter we learn how to represent a network as a graph and introduce the elementary
characteristics of networks, from degrees to degree distributions, from paths to distances and
learn to distinguish weighted, directed and bipartite networks. We will introduce a graph-
theoretic formalism and language that will be used throughout this book

Section 2.2

Networks and Graphs

If we want to understand a complex system, we first need to know how its components interact
with each other. In other words we need a map of its wiring diagram. A network is a catalog of a
system’s components often called nodes or vertices and the direct interactions between them,
called links or edges (BOX 2.1). This network representation offers a common language to study
systems that may differ greatly in nature, appearance, or scope. Indeed, as shown in Image 2.2,
three rather different systems have exactly the same network representation.

Image 2.2 introduces two basic network parameters:

Number of nodes, or N, represents the number of components in the system. We will often call N
the size of the network. To distinguish the nodes, we label them with i = 1, 2, ..., N.

Number of links, which we denote with L, represents the total number of interactions between
the nodes. Links are rarely labeled, as they can be identified through the nodes they connect.
For example, the (2, 4) link connects nodes 2 and 4.

The networks shown in Image 2.2 have N = 4 and L = 4.

Different Networks, Same Graph
The ﬁgure shows a small subset of (a) the Internet, where routers (specialized computers) are
connected to each other; (b) the Hollywood actor network, where two actors are connected if they
played in the same movie; (c) a protein-protein interaction network, where two proteins are connected if
there is experimental evidence that they can bind to each other in the cell. While the nature of the
nodes and the links differs, these networks have the same graph representation, consisting of N = 4
nodes and L = 4 links, shown in (d).

  

The links of a network can be directed or undirected. Some systems have directed links, like the
WWW, whose uniform resource locators (URL) point from one web document to the other, or
phone calls, where one person calls the other. Other systems have undirected links, like
romantic ties: if I date Janet, Janet also dates me, or like transmission lines on the power grid,
on which the electric current can flow in both directions.

A network is called directed (or digraph) if all of its links are directed; it is called undirected if all
of its links are undirected. Some networks simultaneously have directed and undirected links.
For example in the metabolic network some reactions are reversible (i.e., bidirectional or
undirected) and others are irreversible, taking place in only one direction (directed).

The choices we make when we represent a system as a network will determine our ability to use
network science successfully to solve a particular problem. For example, the way we define the
links between two individuals dictates the nature of the questions we can explore:

•  By connecting individuals that regularly interact with each other in the context of their work,
we obtain the organizational or professional network, that plays a key role in the success of a
company or an institution, and is of major interest to organizational research (Image 1.7).
•  By linking friends to each other, we obtain the friendship network, that plays an important role
in the spread of ideas, products and habits and is of major interest to sociology, marketing and
health sciences.
•  By connecting individuals that have an intimate relationship, we obtain the sexual network, of
key importance for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, like AIDS, and of major interest
for epidemiology.
•  By using phone and email records to connect individuals that all or email each other, we
obtain the acquaintance network, capturing a mixture of professional, friendship or intimate
links, of importance to communications and marketing.

In the scientific literature the terms network and graph are used interchangeably:

Vertex

Edge

Yet, there is a subtle distinction between the two terminologies: the {network, node, link}
combination often refers to real systems: The WWW is a network of web documents
linked by URLs; society is a network of individuals linked by family, friendship or
professional ties; the metabolic network is the sum of all chemical reactions that take
place in a cell. In contrast, we use the terms {graph, vertex, edge} when we discuss the
mathematical representation of these networks: We talk about the web graph, the social
graph (a term made popular by Facebook), or the metabolic graph. Yet, this distinction is
rarely made, so these two terminologies are often synonyms of each other.

While many links in these four networks overlap (some coworkers may be friends or may have
an intimate relationship), these networks have different uses and purposes.

We can also build networks that may be valid from a graph theoretic perspective, but may have
little practical utility. For example, if we link all individuals with the same first name, Johns
with Johns and Marys with Marys, we do obtain a well-defined graph, whose properties can be
analyzed with the tools of network science. Its utility is questionable, however. Hence in order
to apply network theory to a system, careful considerations must precede our choice of nodes
and links, ensuring their significance to the problem we wish to explore.

Throughout this book we will use ten networks to illustrate the tools of network science. These
reference networks, listed in Table 2.1, span social systems (mobile call graph or email network),
collaboration and affiliation networks (science collaboration network, Hollywood actor
network), information systems (WWW), technological and infrastructural systems (Internet and
power grid), biological systems (protein interaction and metabolic network), and reference
networks (citations). They differ widely in their sizes, from as few as N =1,039 nodes in the E.
coli metabolism, to almost half million nodes in the citation network. They cover several areas
where networks are actively applied, representing ‘canonical’ datasets frequently used by
researchers to illustrate key network properties. As we indicate in Table 2.1, some of them are
directed, others are undirected. In the coming chapters we will discuss in detail the nature and
the characteristics of each of these datasets, turning them into the guinea pigs of our journey to
understand complex networks.

directed or undirected, the number of nodes (N) and links (L), and the average degree for each
network. For directed networks the average degree shown is the average in- or out-degrees ‹k›

Degree, Average Degree and Degree Distribution

A key property of each node is its degree, representing the number of links it has to other nodes.
The degree can represent the number of mobile phone contacts an individual has in the call

The degree distribution has assumed a central role in network theory following the discovery of

scale-free networks [8]. One reason is that the calculation of most network properties requires

Degree Distribution
The degree distribution of a network is provided by the ratio (2.7).
•  For the network in (a) with N = 4 the degree distribution is shown in (b).
•  We have p1 = 1/4 (one of the four nodes has degree k11 = 1), p2 = 1/2 (two nodes have k3 = k4 = 2), and
p3 = 1/4 (as k2 = 3). As we lack nodes with degree k › 3, pk = 0 for any k › 3.

•  The degree distribution of (c) is a Kronecker’s delta function, pk = δ(k - 2).

achieve this is to provide a complete list of the links. For example, the network of Image 2.2 is
Network Science
uniquely described by listing its four links: {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)}. For mathematical
by Albert-László Barabási
purposes we often represent a network through its adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix of a
directed network of N nodes has N rows and N columns, its elements being:

  

Aij = 1 if there is a link pointing from node j to node i

Aij = 0 if nodes i and j are not connected to each other

The adjacency matrix of an undirected network has two entries for each link, e.g. link (1, 2) is
represented as A12 = 1 and A21 = 1. Hence, the adjacency matrix of an undirected network is
symmetric, Aij = Aji (Image 2.5b)

The degree ki of node i can be directly obtained from the elements of the adjacency matrix. For
undirected networks a node’s degree is a sum over either the rows or the columns of the matrix,
i.e.

N

j=1

The number of nonzero elements of the adjacency matrix is 2L, or twice the number of links.
Indeed, an undirected link connecting nodes i and j appears in two entries: Aij = 1, a link pointing
from node j to node i, and Aji = 1, a link pointing from i to j (Image 2.5b).

Section 2.5

Real Networks are Sparse

In real networks the number of nodes (N) and links (L) can vary widely. For example, the neural
network of the worm C. elegans, the only fully mapped nervous system of a living organism, has
N = 302 neurons (nodes). In contrast the human brain is estimated to have about a hundred
billion (N ≈ 1011) neurons. The genetic network of a human cell has about 20,000 genes as nodes;
the social network consists of seven billion individuals (N ≈ 7×109) and the WWW is estimated to
have over a trillion web documents (N > 1012).

These wide differences in size are noticeable in Table 2.1, which lists N and L for several network
maps. Some of these maps offer a complete wiring diagram of the system they describe (like the
actor network or the E. coli metabolism), while others are only samples, representing a subset of
the full network (like the WWW or the mobile call graph)

Table 2.1 indicates that the number of links also varies widely. In a network of N nodes the
number of links can change between L = 0 and Lmax, where

N(N−1)

=

N
2

=

Lmax
is the total number of links present in a complete graph of size N (Image 2.6). In a complete graph
each node is connected to every other node.

Complete Graph
A complete graph with N = 16 nodes and Lmax = 120 links, as predicted by (2.12). The adjacency matrix of
a complete graph is Aij = 1 for all i, j = 1, .... N and Aii = 0. The average degree of a complete graph is ‹k› =
N - 1. A complete graph is often called a clique, a term frequently used in community identiﬁcation, a
problem discussed in CHAPTER 9.

In real networks L is much smaller than Lmax, reflecting the fact that most real networks are
sparse. We call a network sparse if L‹‹ Lmax. For example, the WWW graph in Table 2.1 has about
1.5 million links. Yet, if the WWW were to be a complete graph, it should have Lmax ≈ 5x1010 links
according to (2.12). Consequently the web graph has only a 3x10-5 fraction of the links it could

nodes.

The sparsity of real networks implies that the adjacency matrices are also sparse. Indeed, a
complete network has Aij = 1, for all (i, j), i.e. each of its matrix elements are equal to one. In
contrast in real networks only a tiny fraction of the matrix elements are nonzero. This is
illustrated in Image 2.7, which shows the adjacency matrix of the protein-protein interaction
network listed in Table 2.1 and shown in Image 2.4a. One can see that the matrix is nearly
empty.

Sparseness has important consequences on the way we explore and store real networks. For
example, when we store a large network in our computer, it is better to store only the list of
links (i.e. elements for which Aij ≠ 0), rather than the full adjacency matrix, as an overwhelming
fraction of the Aij elements are zero. Hence the matrix representation will block a huge chunk of
memory, filled mainly with zeros (Image 2.7).

For weighted networks the elements of the adjacency matrix carry the weight of the link as

Most networks of scientific interest are weighted, but we can not always measure the
appropriate weights. Consequently we often approximate these networks with an unweighted
graph. In this book we predominantly focus on unweighted networks, but whenever
appropriate, we discuss how the weights alter the corresponding network property (BOX 2.3).

Box 2.3

Metcalfe’s Law: the Value of a Network

Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number
of its nodes, i.e. N2. Formulated around 1980 in the context of communication devices by
Robert M. Metcalfe [9], the idea behind Metcalfe’s law is that the more individuals use a
network, the more valuable it becomes. Indeed, the more of your friends use email, the
more valuable the service is to you.

During the Internet boom of the late 1990s Metcalfe’s law was frequently used to offer a
quantitative valuation for Internet companies. It suggested that the value of a service is
proportional to the number of connections it can create, which is the square of the
number of its users. In contrast the cost grows only linearly with N. Hence if the service
attracts sufficient number of users, it will inevitably become profitable, as N2 will surpass
N at some large N (Image 2.8). Metcalfe’s Law therefore supported a “build it and they will
come” mentality [10], offering credibility to growth over profits.

Metcalfe’s law is based on (2.12), telling us that if all links of a communication network
with N users are equally valuable, the total value of the network is proportional to N(N -
1)/2, that is, roughly, N2. If a network has N = 10 consumers, there are Lmax = 45 different
possible connections between them. If the network doubles in size to N = 20, the number
of connections doesn’t merely double but roughly quadruples to 190, a phenomenon
called network externality in economics.

Two issues limit the validity of Metcalfe’s law:

•  Most real networks are sparse, which means that only a very small fraction of the links

are present. Hence the value of the network does not grow like N2, but increases only
linearly with N.
•  As the links have weights, not all links are of equal value. Some links are used heavily
while the vast majority of links are rarely utilized.

  

Image 2.8
Metcalfe’s Law
According to Metcalfe’s law the cost of network based services increases linearly with the
number of nodes (users or devices). In contrast the beneﬁts or income are driven by the number
of links Lmax the technology makes possible, which grows like N2 according to (2.12). Hence once
the number of users or devices exceeds some critical mass, the technology becomes proﬁtable.

Bipartite Networks
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a network whose nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets U and
V such that each link connects a U-node to a V-node. In other words, if we color the U-nodes
green and the V-nodes purple, then each link must connect nodes of different colors (Image
2.9).

  

We can generate two projections for each bipartite network. The first projection connects two
U-nodes by a link if they are linked to the same V-node in the bipartite representation. The
second projection connects the V-nodes by a link if they connect to the same U-node (Image
2.9).

Image 2.9
Bipartite Network
A bipartite network has two sets of nodes, U and V. Nodes in the U-set connect directly only to nodes in
the V-set. Hence there are no direct U-U or V-V links. The ﬁgure shows the two projections we can
generate from any bipartite network. Projection U is obtained by connecting two U-nodes to each other
if they link to the same V-node in the bipartite representation. Projection V is obtained by connecting

actors (V). A movie is connected to an actor if the actor plays in that movie. One projection of
this bipartite network is the actor network, in which two nodes are connected to each other if
they played in the same movie. This is the network listed in Table 2.1. The other projection is the
movie network, in which two movies are connected if they share at least one actor in their cast.

Paths and Distances

Physical distance plays a key role in determining the interactions between the components of
physical systems. For example the distance between two atoms in a crystal or between two
galaxies in the universe determine the forces that act between them.

In networks distance is a challenging concept. Indeed, what is the distance between two
webpages, or between two individuals who do not know each other? The physical distance is not
relevant here: Two webpages could be sitting on computers on the opposite sides of the globe,
yet, have a link to each other. At the same time two individuals that live in the same building
may not know each other.

In networks physical distance is replaced by path length. A path is a route that runs along the
links of the network. A path’s length represents the number of links the path contains (Image
2.12a). Note that some texts require that each node a path visits is distinct.

In network science paths play a central role. Next we discuss some of their most important
properties, many more being summarized in (Image 2.13).

Paths
•  A path between nodes i0 and in is an ordered list of n links P = {(i0, i1), (i1, i2), (i2, i3), ... ,(in-1, in)}. The
length of this path is n. The path shown in orange in (a) follows the route 1→2→5→7→4→6, hence its
length is n = 5.
•  The shortest paths between nodes 1 and 7, or the distance d17, correspond to the path with the
fewest number of links that connect nodes 1 to 7. There can be multiple paths of the same length, as
illustrated by the two paths shown in orange and grey. The network diameter is the largest distance in
the network, being dmax = 3 here.

Shortest Path

The shortest path between nodes i and j is the path with the fewest number of links (Image
2.12b). The shortest path is often called the distance between nodes i and j, and is denoted by dij,
or simply d. We can have multiple shortest paths of the same length d between a pair of nodes
(Image 2.12b). The shortest path never contains loops or intersects itself.

In an undirected network dij = dji, i.e. the distance between node i and j is the same as the
distance between node i and j. In a directed network often dij ≠ dji. Furthermore, in a directed
network the existence of a path from node i to node j does not guarantee the existence of a path
from j to i.

In real networks we often need to determine the distance between two nodes. For a small
network, like the one shown in Image 2.12, this is an easy task. For a network with millions of
nodes finding the shortest path between two nodes can be rather time consuming. The length of
the shortest path and the number of such paths can be formally obtained from the adjacency

We can use the BFS algorithm to determine the average path length for a large network. For this
we first determine the distances between the first node and all other nodes in the network using
the algorithm described in BOX 2.5. We then determine the distances between the second node
and all other nodes but the first one (if the network is undirected). We then repeat this

Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

BFS is a frequently used algorithms in network science. Similar to throwing a pebble in a
pond and watching the ripples spread from it, BFS starts from a node and labels its
neighbors, then the neighbors’ neighbors, until it reaches the target node. The number of
“ripples” needed to reach the target provides the distance.

The identification of the shortest path between node i and j follows the following steps
(Image 2.14):

• Start at node i, that we label with “0”.
• Find the nodes directly linked to i. Label them distance “1” and put them in a queue.
• Take the first node, labeled n, out of the queue (n = 1 in the first step). Find the
unlabeled nodes adjacent to it in the graph. Label them with n + 1 and put them in the
queue.
• Repeat step 3 until you find the target node j or there are no more nodes in the queue.
• The distance between i and j is the label of j. If j does not have a label, then dij = ∞.

The computational complexity of the BFS algorithm, representing the approximate
number of steps the computer needs to find dij on a network of N nodes and L links, is O(N
+ L). It is linear in N and L as each node needs to be entered and removed from the queue
at most once, and each link has to be tested only once.

Applying the BFS Algorithm
•  Starting from the orange node, labeled ”0”, we identify all its neighbors, labeling them ”1”.
•  Next we label ”2” the unlabeled neighbors of all nodes labeled ”1”, and so on, in each iteration
increasing the label number, until no node is left unlabeled. The length of the shortest path or the
distance d0i between node 0 and any other node i in the network is given by the label of node i.
For example, the distance between node 0 and the leftmost node is d = 3.

Section 2.9

Connectedness

A phone would be of limited use as a communication device if we could not call any valid phone
number; email would be rather useless if we could send emails to only certain email addresses,
and not to others. From a network perspective this means that the network behind the phone or
the Internet must be capable of establishing a path between any two nodes. This is in fact the
key utility of most networks: they ensure connectedness. In this section we discuss the graph-
theoretic formulation of connectedness.

In an undirected network nodes i and j are connected if there is a path between them. They are
disconnected if such a path does not exist, in which case we have dij = ∞. This is illustrated in
Image 2.15a, which shows a network consisting of two disconnected clusters. While there are
paths between any two nodes on the same cluster (for example nodes 4 and 6), there are no
paths between nodes that belong to different clusters (nodes 1 and 6).

if there is at least one pair with dij = ∞. Clearly the network shown in Image 2.15a is

disconnected, and we call its two subnetworks components or clusters. A component is a subset of
nodes in a network, so that there is a path between any two nodes that belong to the
component, but one cannot add any more nodes to it that would have the same property.

  

If a network consists of two components, a properly placed single link can connect them,
making the network connected (Image 2.15b). Such a link is called a bridge. In general a bridge is
any link that, if cut, disconnects the network.

While for a small network visual inspection can help us decide if it is connected or disconnected,
for a network consisting of millions of nodes connectedness is a challenging question.
Mathematical and algorithmic tools can help us identify the connected components of a graph.
For example, for a disconnected network the adjacency matrix can be rearranged into a block
diagonal form, such that all nonzero elements in the matrix are contained in square blocks along
the matrix’ diagonal and all other elements are zero (Image 2.15a). Each square block
corresponds to a component. We can use the tools of linear algebra to decide if the adjacency
matrix is block diagonal, helping us to identify the connected components.

In practice, for large networks the components are more efficiently identified using the BFS
algorithm (BOX 2.6).

•  Ci = 1 if the neighbors of node i form a complete graph, i.e. they all link to each other.
•  Ci is the probability that two neighbors of a node link to each other. Consequently C = 0.5
implies that there is a 50% chance that two neighbors of a node are linked.

In summary Ci measures the network’s local link density: The more densely interconnected the
neighborhood of node i, the higher is its local clustering coefficient.

Summary

The crash course offered in this chapter introduced some of the basic graph theoretical concepts
and tools used in network science. The set of elementary network characteristics, summarized
in Image 2.17, offer a formal language through which we can explore networks.

Many of the networks we study in network science consist of thousands or even millions of
nodes and links (Table 2.1). To explore them, we need to go beyond the small graphs shown in
Image 2.17. A glimpse of what we are about to encounter is offered by the protein-protein
interaction network of yeast (Image 2.4a). The network is too complex to understand its
properties through a visual inspection of its wiring diagram. We therefore need to turn to the
tools of network science to characterize its topology.

Graphology
In network science we often distinguish networks by some elementary property of the underlying graph.
Here we summarize the most commonly encountered network types. We also list real systems that share
the particular property. Note that many real networks combine several of these elementary network
characteristics. For example the WWW is a directed multi-graph with self-interactions; the mobile call
network is directed and weighted, without self-loops.

Undirected Network
A network whose links do not have a deﬁned direction.
Examples: Internet, power grid, science collaboration networks.

Self-loops
In many networks nodes do not interact with themselves, so the diagonal elements of the adjacency
matrix are zero, Aii = 0, i = 1,..., N. In some systems self-interactions are allowed; in such networks, self-
loops represent the fact that node i interacts with itself.
Examples: WWW, protein interactions.

Multigraph/Simple Graphs
In a multigraph nodes are permitted to have multiple links (or parallel links) between them. Hence Aii can

be any positive integer. Networks that do not allow multiple links are called simple.

  

Weighted Network
A network whose links have a deﬁned weight, strength or ﬂow parameter. The elements of the adjacency
matrix are Aij = wij if there is a link with weight wij between them. For unweighted (binary) networks, the
adjacency matrix only indicates the presence (Aij = 1) or the absence (Aij = 0) of a link.
Examples: Mobile phone calls, email network.

Complete Graph (Clique)
In a complete graph, or a clique, all nodes are connected to each other.
Examples: Actors in the cast of the same movie, as they are all linked to each other in the actor network.

Let us use the measures we introduced so far to explore some basic characteristics of this
network. The undirected network, shown in Image 2.4a, has N = 2,018 proteins as nodes and
L=2,930 binding interactions as links. Hence its average degree, according to (2.2), is 〈k〉 = 2.90,
suggesting that a typical protein interacts with approximately two to three other proteins. Yet,
this number is somewhat misleading. Indeed, the degree distribution pk shown in Image 2.4b,c,
indicates that the vast majority of nodes have only a few links. To be precise, in this network
69% of nodes have fewer than three links, i.e. for these k ‹ 〈k〉 . These numerous nodes with few
links coexist with a few highly connected nodes, or hubs, the largest having as many as 92 links.
Such wide differences in node degrees is a consequence of the network’s scale-free property,
discussed in CHAPTER 4. We will see that the shape of the degree distribution determines a wide
range of network properties, from the network’s robustness to the spread of viruses.

The breadth-first-search algorithm (BOX 2.5) helps us determine the network’s diameter,
finding dmax = 14. We might be tempted to expect wide variations in d, as some nodes are close
to each other, others, however, may be quite far. The distance distribution (Image 2.18a)
indicates otherwise: pd has a prominent peak between 5 and 6, telling us that most distances are
rather short, being in the vicinity of 〈d〉 =5.61. Also, pd decays fast for large d, suggesting that
large distances are absent. Indeed, the variance of the distances is σd = 1.64, indicating that most
path lengths are in the close vicinity of 〈d〉 . These are manifestations of the small world
property discussed in CHAPTER 3.

The breadth first search algorithm also tells us that the protein interaction network is not
connected, but consists of 185 components, shown as isolated clusters and nodes in Image 2.4a.
The largest, called the giant component, contains 1,647 of the 2,018 nodes; all other components
are tiny. As we will see in the coming chapters, such fragmentation is common in real networks.

by Albert-László Barabási
A further caveat is provided by the dependence of the clustering coefficient on the node’s
degree, or the C(k) function (Image 2.18b). The fact that C(k) decreases for large k indicates that
the local clustering coefficient of the small nodes is significantly higher than the local clustering
coefficient of the hubs. Hence the small degree nodes are located in dense local network
neighborhoods, while the neighborhood of the hubs is much sparser. This is a consequence of
hierarchy, a network property discussed in CHAPTER 9.

Finally, a visual inspection reveals an interesting pattern: hubs have a tendency to connect to
small nodes, giving the network a hub and spoke character (Image 2.4a). This is a consequence
of degree correlations, discussed in CHAPTER 7. Such correlations influence a number of
network based processes, from spreading phenomena to the number of driver nodes needed to
control a network.

Taken together, Image 2.4 and 2.18 illustrate that the quantities we introduced in this chapter
can help us diagnose several key properties of real networks. The purpose of the coming
chapters is to study systematically these network characteristics and understand what they tell
us about a particular complex system.

contrast a chain of connected nodes A, B, C, in which B connects to A and C, but A does not link
to C, forms a single open triplet ABC. The factor three in the numerator of (2.17) is due to the
fact that each triangle is counted three times in the triplet count. The roots of the global
clustering coefficient go back to the social network literature of the 1940s [17, 18], where CΔ is

Note that the average clustering coefficient ‹C› defined in (2.16) and the global clustering
coefficient (2.17) are not equivalent. Indeed, take a network that is a double star, consisting of N

other links. Then the local clustering coefficient Ci is 1 for i ≥ 3 and 2/(N − 1) for i = 1, 2. It follows
that the average clustering coefficient of the network is ‹C› = 1−O(1), while the global clustering
coefficient is CΔ ~ 1/N. In less extreme networks the two definitions will give more comparable

Introduction

Imagine organizing a party for a hundred guests who initially do not know each other [1]. Offer
them wine and cheese and you will soon see them chatting in groups of two to three. Now
mention to Mary, one of your guests, that the red wine in the unlabeled dark green bottles is a
rare vintage, much better than the one with the fancy red label. If she shares this information
only with her acquaintances, your expensive wine appears to be safe, as she only had time to
meet a few others so far.

The guests will continue to mingle, however, creating subtle paths between individuals that may
still be strangers to each other. For example, while John has not yet met Mary, they have both
met Mike, so there is an invisible path from John to Mary through Mike. As time goes on, the
guests will be increasingly interwoven by such elusive links. With that the secret of the
unlabeled bottle will pass from Mary to Mike and from Mike to John, escaping into a rapidly
expanding group.

To be sure, when all guests had gotten to know each other, everyone would be pouring the
superior wine. But if each encounter took only ten minutes, meeting all ninety-nine others
would take about sixteen hours. Thus, you could reasonably hope that a few drops of your fine
wine would be left for you to enjoy once the guests are gone.

Yet, you would be wrong. In this chapter we show you why. We will see that the party maps into
a classic model in network science called the random network model. And random network
theory tells us that we do not have to wait until all individuals get to know each other for our
expensive wine to be in danger. Rather, soon after each person meets at least one other guest,
an invisible network will emerge that will allow the information to reach all of them. Hence in
no time everyone will be enjoying the better wine.

The Random Network Model

Network science aims to build models that reproduce the properties of real networks. Most
networks we encounter do not have the comforting regularity of a crystal lattice or the
predictable radial architecture of a spider web. Rather, at first inspection they look as if they
were spun randomly (Image 2.4). Random network theory embraces this apparent randomness
by constructing and characterizing networks that are truly random.

From a modeling perspective a network is a relatively simple object, consisting of only nodes
and links. The real challenge, however, is to decide where to place the links between the nodes
so that we reproduce the complexity of a real system. In this respect the philosophy behind a
random network is simple: We assume that this goal is best achieved by placing the links
randomly between the nodes. That takes us to the definition of a random network (BOX 3.1):

A random network consists of N nodes where each node pair is connected with probability p.

Box 3.1

Defining Random Networks

There are two definitions of a random network:

  

•  G(N, L) Model: N labeled nodes are connected with L randomly placed links. Erdős and
Rényi used this definition in their string of papers on random networks [2-9]
•  G(N, p) Model: Each pair of N labeled nodes is connected with probability p, a model
introduced by Gilbert [10].

Hence, the G(N, p) model fixes the probability p that two nodes are connected and the G(N,
L)) model fixes the total number of links L. While in the G(N, L) model the average degree
of a node is simply ‹k› = 2L/N, other network characteristics are easier to calculate in the
G(N, p) model. Throughout this book we will explore the G(N, p) model, not only for the
ease that it allows us to calculate key network characteristics, but also because in real
networks the number of links rarely stays fixed.

To construct a random network we follow these steps:

• Start with N isolated nodes.
• Select a node pair and generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number exceeds p,
connect the selected node pair with a link, otherwise leave them disconnected.
• Repeat step (2) for each of the N(N-1)/2 node pairs.

The network obtained after this procedure is called a random graph or a random network. Two
mathematicians, Pál Erdős and Alfréd Rényi, have played an important role in understanding
the properties of these networks. In their honor a random network is called the Erdős-Rényi
network (BOX 3.2).

N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős
The 1993 biographical documentary of Pál Erdős, directed by George Paul Csicsery, offers a
glimpse into Erdős' life and scientiﬁc impact [14].

Anatol Rapoport (1911-2007), a Russian immigrant to the United States, was the first to
study random networks. Rapoport’s interests turned to mathematics after realizing that a
successful career as a concert pianist would require a wealthy patron. He focused on
mathematical biology at a time when mathematicians and biologists hardly spoke to each
other. In a paper written with Ray Solomonoff in 1951 [11], Rapoport demonstrated that if
we increase the average degree of a network, we observe an abrupt transition from
disconnected nodes to a graph with a giant component.

The study of random networks reached prominence thanks to the fundamental work of
Pál Erdős and Alfréd Rényi (Image 3.2). In a sequence of eight papers published between
1959 and 1968 [2-9], they merged probability theory and combinatorics with graph theory,
establishing random graph theory, a new branch of mathematics [2].

The random network model was independently introduced by Edgar Nelson Gilbert
(1923-2013) [10] the same year Erdős and Rényi published their first paper on the subject.
Yet, the impact of Erdős and Rényi’s work is so overwhelming that they are rightly
considered the founders of random graph theory.

Number of Links

  

Each random network generated with the same parameters N, p looks slightly different (Image
3.3). Not only the detailed wiring diagram changes between realizations, but so does the number
of links L. It is useful, therefore, to determine how many links we expect for a particular
realization of a random network with fixed Nand p.

The probability that a random network has exactly L links is the product of three terms:

• The probability that L of the attempts to connect the N(N-1)/2 pairs of nodes have resulted in a
link, which is pL.
• The probability that the remaining N(N-1)/2 - L attempts have not resulted in a link, which is
(1-p)N(N-1)/2-L.
• A combinational factor,

counting the number of different ways we can place L links among N(N-1)/2 node pairs.

We can therefore write the probability that a particular realization of a random network has
exactly L links as

Binomial vs. Poisson Degree Distribution
The exact form of the degree distribution of a random network is the binomial distribution(left half). For
N ›› ‹k› the binomial is well approximated by a Poisson distribution (right half). As both formulas describe
the same distribution,they have the identical properties, but they are expressed in terms of different
parameters: The binomial distribution depends on p and N, while the Poisson distribution has only one
parameter, ‹k›. It is this simplicity that makes the Poisson form preferred in calculations.

Binomial Distribution

In a random network the probability that node i has exactly k links is the product of three terms
[15]:

• The probability that k of its links are present, or pk.
• The probability that the remaining (N-1-k) links are missing, or (1-p)N-1-k
• The number of ways we can select k links from N- 1 potential links a node can have, or

The shape of this distribution depends on the system size N and the probability p (Image 3.4).
The binomial distribution (BOX 3.3) allows us to calculate the network’s average degree ‹k›,
recovering (3.3), as well as its second moment ‹k2› and variance σk (Image 3.4).

Poisson Distribution

Most real networks are sparse, meaning that for them ‹k› ‹‹ N (Table 2.1). In this limit the
degree distribution (3.7) is well approximated by the Poisson distribution (ADVANCED TOPICS
3.A)

=

e−⟨k⟩ ⟨k⟩k
k!

pk
which is often called, together with (3.7), the degree distribution of a random network.

(3. 8)

The binomial and the Poisson distribution describe the same quantity, hence they have similar
properties (Image 3.4):

•  Both distributions have a peak around ‹k›. If we increase p the network becomes denser,
increasing ‹k› and moving the peak to the right.
•  The width of the distribution (dispersion) is also controlled by p or ‹k›. The denser the
network, the wider is the distribution, hence the larger are the differences in the degrees.

When we use the Poisson form (3.8), we need to keep in mind that:

•  The exact result for the degree distribution is the binomial form (3.7), thus (3.8) represents
only an approximation to (3.7) valid in the ‹k› ‹‹ N limit. As most networks of practical
importance are sparse, this condition is typically satisfied.
•  The advantage of the Poisson form is that key network characteristics, like <‹k›, ‹k2› and σk ,
have a much simpler form (Image 3.4), depending on a single parameter, ‹k›.
•  The Poisson distribution in (3.8) does not explicitly depend on the number of nodes N.
Therefore, (3.8) predicts that the degree distribution of networks of different sizes but the same
average degree ‹k› are indistinguishable from each other (Image 3.5).

In summary, while the Poisson distribution is only an approximation to the degree distribution
of a random network, thanks to its analytical simplicity, it is the preferred form for pk. Hence
throughout this book, unless noted otherwise, we will refer to the Poisson form (3.8) as the
degree distribution of a random network. Its key feature is that its properties are independent of
the network size and depend on a single parameter, the average degree ‹k›.

Small Networks: Binomial
For a small network (N = 102) the degree distribution deviates signiﬁcantly from the Poisson form (3.8),

Large Networks: Poisson

estimating the size of the largest and the smallest node in a random network.
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
Let us assume that the world’s social network is described by the random network model. This
random society may not be as far fetched as it first sounds: There is significant randomness in
whom we meet and whom we choose to become acquainted with.

  

Sociologists estimate that a typical person knows about 1,000 individuals on a first name basis,
prompting us to assume that ‹k› ≈ 1,000. Using the results obtained so far about random
networks, we arrive to a number of intriguing conclusions about a random society of N ≈ 7 x 109
of individuals (ADVANCED TOPICS 3.B):

•  The most connected individual (the largest degree node) in a random society is expected to
have kmax = 1,185 acquaintances.
•  The degree of the least connected individual is kmin = 816, not that different from kmax or ‹k›.
•  The dispersion of a random network is σk = ‹k›1/2 , which for ‹k› = 1,000 is σk = 31.62. This
means that the number of friends a typical individual has is in the ‹k› ± σk range, or between
968 and 1,032, a rather narrow window.

Taken together, in a random society all individuals are expected to have a comparable number of
friends. Hence if people are randomly connected to each other, we lack outliers: There are no
highly popular individuals, and no one is left behind, having only a few friends. This suprising
conclusion is a consequence of an important property of random networks: in a large random
network the degree of most nodes is in the narrow vicinity of ‹k›

This prediction blatantly conflicts with reality. Indeed, there is extensive evidence of individuals
who have considerably more than 1,185 acquaintances. For example, US president Franklin
Delano Roosevelt’s appointment book has about 22,000 names, individuals he met personally
[16, 17]. Similarly, a study of the social network behind Facebook has documented numerous
individuals with 5,000 Facebook friends, the maximum allowed by the social networking
platform [18]. To understand the origin of these discrepancies we must compare the degree
distribution of real and random networks.

both k-dependent terms in (3.9), i.e. 1/√k and (e‹k›/k)k decrease rapidly with increasing k.
Overall (3.9) predicts that in a random network the chance of observing a hub decreases
faster than exponentially.

indicates that the random network model underestimates the size and the frequency of the high degree
nodes, as well as the number of low degree nodes. Instead the random network model predicts a larger
number of nodes in the vicinity of ‹k› than seen in real networks.

process: Starting with N isolated nodes, the links are added gradually through random

increases from 0 to N-1. Yet, as Image 3.7a indicates, this is not the case: NG/N remains zero for
small ‹k›, indicating the lack of a large cluster. Once ‹k› exceeds a critical value, NG/N increases,
signaling the rapid emergence of a large cluster that we call the giant component. Erdős and Rényi
in their classical 1959 paper predicted that the condition for the emergence of the giant
component is [2]

The fact that we need at least one link per node to observe a giant component is not unexpected.
Network Science
  
Indeed, for a giant component to exist, each of its nodes must be linked to at least one other
by Albert-László Barabási
node. It is somewhat counterintuitive, however, that one link is suﬃcient for its emergence.

We can express (3.10) in terms of p using (3.3), obtaining

Therefore the larger a network, the smaller p is sufficient for the giant component.

(3. 11)

N

The emergence of the giant component is only one of the transitions characterizing a random
network as we change ‹k›. We can distinguish four topologically distinct regimes (Image 3.7a),
each with its unique characteristics:

Subcritical Regime: 0 ‹ ‹k› ‹ 1 (p ‹ 1/N , Image 3.7b).

For ‹k› = 0 the network consists of N isolated nodes. Increasing ‹k› means that we are adding
N‹k› = pN(N-1)/2 links to the network. Yet, given that ‹k› ‹ 1, we have only a small number of
links in this regime, hence we mainly observe tiny clusters (Image 3.7b).

We can designate at any moment the largest cluster to be the giant component. Yet in this
regime the relative size of the largest cluster, NG/N, remains zero. The reason is that for ‹k› ‹ 1
the largest cluster is a tree with size NG ~ lnN, hence its size increases much slower than the size

of the network. Therefore NG/N ≃ lnN/N→0 in the N→∞ limit.

In summary, in the subcritical regime the network consists of numerous tiny components,
whose size follows the exponential distribution (3.35). Hence these components have
comparable sizes, lacking a clear winner that we could designate as a giant component.

Critical Point: ‹k› = 1 (p = 1/N , Image 3.7c).

The critical point separates the regime where there is not yet a giant component (‹k› ‹ 1) from
the regime where there is one (‹k› › 1). At this point the relative size of the largest component is
still zero (Image 3.7c). Indeed, the size of the largest component is NG ~ N2/3. Consequently NG
grows much slower than the network’s size, so its relative size decreases as NG/N ~ N -1/3 in the
N→∞ limit.

Note, however, that in absolute terms there is a significant jump in the size of the largest
component at ‹k› = 1. For example, for a random network with N = 7 ×109 nodes, comparable to

the globe’s social network, for ‹k› ‹ 1 the largest cluster is of the order of NG ≃ lnN = ln (7 ×109)
≃ 22.7. In contrast at ‹k› = 1 we expect NG ~ N2/3 = (7 ×109)2/3 ≃ 3 ×106, a jump of about five orders

In summary, at the critical point most nodes are located in numerous small components, whose
size distribution follows (3.36). The power law form indicates that components of rather
different sizes coexist. These numerous small components are mainly trees, while the giant
component may contain loops. Note that many properties of the network at the critical point
resemble the properties of a physical system undergoing a phase transition (ADVANCED TOPICS

Note that (3.12) is valid only in the vicinity of ‹k› = 1. For large ‹k› the dependence between NG
and ‹k› is nonlinear (Image 3.7a).

  

In summary in the supercritical regime numerous isolated components coexist with the giant
component, their size distribution following (3.35). These small components are trees, while the
giant component contains loops and cycles. The supercritical regime lasts until all nodes are
absorbed by the giant component.

Connected Regime: ‹k› › lnN (p › lnN/N , Image 3.7e).

For sufficiently large p the giant component absorbs all nodes and components, hence NG≃ N. In

the absence of isolated nodes the network becomes connected. The average degree at which this
happens depends on N as (ADVANCED TOPIC 3.E)

⟨k⟩ = ln N
Note that when we enter the connected regime the network is still relatively sparse, as lnN / N →
0 for large N. The network turns into a complete graph only at ‹k› = N - 1.

(3. 14)

In summary, the random network model predicts that the emergence of a network is not a
smooth, gradual process: The isolated nodes and tiny components observed for small ‹k›
collapse into a giant component through a phase transition (ADVANCED TOPICS 3.F). As we vary
‹k› we encounter four topologically distinct regimes (Image 3.7).

The discussion offered above follows an empirical perspective, fruitful if we wish to compare a
random network to real systems. A different perspective, with its own rich behavior, is offered
by the mathematical literature (BOX 3.5).

For example, for z less than -3/2 almost all graphs contain only isolated nodes and pairs
of nodes connected by a link. Once z exceeds -3/2, most networks will contain paths
connecting three or more nodes (Image 3.8).

Real Networks are Supercritical

Two predictions of random network theory are of direct importance for real networks:

•  Once the average degree exceeds ‹k› = 1, a giant component should emerge that contains a
finite fraction of all nodes. Hence only for ‹k› › 1 the nodes organize themselves into a
recognizable network.
•  For ‹k› › lnN all components are absorbed by the giant component, resulting in a single
connected network.

Do real networks satisfy the criteria for the existence of a giant component, i.e. ‹k› › 1? And will
this giant component contain all nodes for ‹k› › lnN, or will we continue to see some
disconnected nodes and components? To answer these questions we compare the structure of a
real network for a given ‹k› with the theoretical predictions discussed above.

The measurements indicate that real networks extravagantly exceed the ‹k› = 1 threshold.
Indeed, sociologists estimate that an average person has around 1,000 acquaintances; a typical

This conclusion is supported by Table 3.1, that lists the average degree of several undirected
networks, in each case finding ‹k› › 1. Hence the average degree of real networks is well beyond
the ‹k› = 1 threshold, implying that they all have a giant component. The same is true for the
reference networks listed in Table 3.1.

Are Real Networks Connected?
The number of nodes N and links L for the undirected networks of our reference network list of
Table 3.1, shown together with ‹k› and lnN. A giant component is expected for ‹k› › 1 and all
nodes should join the giant component for ‹k› › lnN. While for all networks ‹k› › 1, for most ‹k›
is under the lnN threshold (see also Image 3.9).
Let us now turn to the second prediction, inspecting if we have single component (i.e. if ‹k› ›
lnN), or if the network is fragmented into multiple components (i.e. if ‹k› ‹ lnN). For social
networks the transition between the supercritical and the fully connected regime should be at
‹k› › ln(7×109) ≈ 22.7. That is, if the average individual has more than two dozens
acquaintances, then a random society must have a single component, leaving no individual
disconnected. With ‹k› ≈ 1,000 this condition is clearly satisfied. Yet, according to Table 3.1
many real networks do not obey the fully connected criteria. Consequently, according to random
network theory these networks should be fragmented into several disconnected components.
This is a disconcerting prediction for the Internet, indicating that some routers should be
disconnected from the giant component, being unable to communicate with other routers. It is
equally problematic for the power grid, indicating that some consumers should not get power.
These predictions are clearly at odds with reality.

In summary, we find that most real networks are in the supercritical regime (Image 3.9).
Therefore these networks are expected to have a giant component, which is in agreement with
the observations. Yet, this giant component should coexist with many disconnected
components, a prediction that fails for several real networks. Note that these predictions should

Small Worlds

The small world phenomenon, also known as six degrees of separation, has long fascinated the
general public. It states that if you choose any two individuals anywhere on Earth, you will find a
path of at most six acquaintances between them (Image 3.10). The fact that individuals who live
in the same city are only a few handshakes from each other is by no means surprising. The small
world concept states, however, that even individuals who are on the opposite side of the globe

Six Deegree of Separation
According to six degrees of separation two individuals, anywhere in the world, can be connected
through a chain of six or fewer acquaintances. This means that while Sarah does not know Peter, she
knows Ralph, who knows Jane and who in turn knows Peter. Hence Sarah is three handshakes, or three
degrees from Peter. In the language of network science six degrees, also called the small world property,
means that the distance between any two nodes in a network is unexpectedly small.

In the language of network science the small world phenomenon implies that the distance
between two randomly chosen nodes in a network is short. This statement raises two questions:
What does short (or small) mean, i.e. short compared to what? How do we explain the existence
of these short distances?

Both questions are answered by a simple calculation. Consider a random network with average

• ‹k› nodes at distance one (d=1).
• ‹k›2 nodes at distance two (d=2).
• ‹k›3 nodes at distance three (d =3).

• ‹k›d nodes at distance d.

For example, if ‹k› ≈ 1,000, which is the estimated number of acquaintences an individual has,
we expect 106 individuals at distance two and about a billion, i.e. almost the whole earth’s
population, at distance three from us.

To be precise, the expected number of nodes up to distance d from our starting node is

which represents the mathematical formulation of the small world phenomenon. The key,
however is its interpretation:

•  As derived, (3.18) predicts the scaling of the network diameter, dmax, with the size of the
system, N. Yet, for most networks (3.18) offers a better approximation to the average distance
between two randomly chosen nodes, ‹d›, than to dmax (Table 3.2). This is because dmax is often
dominated by a few extreme paths, while ‹d› is averaged over all node pairs, a process that
supresses the fluctuations. Hence typically the small world property is defined by
⟨d⟩ ≈
describing the dependence of the average distance in a network on N and ‹k›.
•  In general lnN « N, hence the dependence of ‹d› on lnN implies that the distances in a
random network are orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the network. Consequently by small

in the "small world phenomenon" we mean that the average path length or the diameter depends
Network Science
logarithmically on the system size. Hence, “small” means that ‹d› is proportional to lnN, rather
by Albert-László Barabási
than N or some power of N (Image 3.11).
•  The 1/ln ‹k› term implies that the denser the network, the smaller is the distance between
the nodes.
•  In real networks there are systematic corrections to (3.19), rooted in the fact that the number
of nodes at distance d › ‹d› drops rapidly (ADVANCED TOPICS 3.F).

  

Image 3.11
Why are Small Worlds Surprising?
Much of our intuition about distance is based on our experience with regular lattices, which do not
display the small world property:

1D: For a one-dimensional lattice (a line of length N) the diameter and the average path length scale
linearly with N: dmax~‹d› ~N.

2D: For a square lattice dmax~‹d› ~ N1/2.

3D: For a cubic lattice dmax~‹d› ~ N1/3.

4D: In general, for a d-dimensional lattice dmax~‹d› ~ N1/d.

These polynomial dependences predict a much faster increase with N than (3.19), indicating that in
lattices the path lengths are signiﬁcantly longer than in a random network. For example, if the social
network would form a square lattice (2D), where each individual knows only its neighbors, the average
distance between two individuals would be roughly (7 ×109)1/2 = 83,666. Even if we correct for the fact
that a person has about 1,000 acquaintances, not four, the average separation will be orders of
magnitude larger than predicted by (3.19).

Therefore, all individuals on Earth should be within three to four handshakes of each other [20].
The estimate (3.20) is probably closer to the real value than the frequently quoted six degrees
(BOX 3.7).

Much of what we know about the small world property in random networks, including the result
(3.19), is in a little known paper by Manfred Kochen and Ithiel de Sola Pool [20], in which they
mathematically formulated the problem and discussed in depth its sociological implications.
This paper inspired the well known Milgram experiment (BOX 3.6), which in turn inspired the
six-degrees of separation phrase.

While discovered in the context of social systems, the small world property applies beyond
social networks (BOX 3.6). To demonstrate this in Table 3.2 we compare the prediction of (3.19)
with the average path length ‹d› for several real networks, finding that despite the diversity of
these systems and the significant differences between them in terms of N and ‹k›, (3.19) offers a
good approximation to the empirically observed ‹d›.

Box 3.6

19 Degrees of Separation

How many clicks do we need to reach a randomly chosen document on the Web? The
difficulty in addressing this question is rooted in the fact that we lack a complete map of
the WWW—we only have access to small samples of the full map. We can start, however,
by measuring the WWW’s average path length in samples of increasing sizes, a procedure
called ﬁnite size scaling. The measurements indicate that the average path length of the
WWW increases with the size of the network as [21]

⟨d⟩ ≈ 0.35 + 0.89 ln N
In 1999 the WWW was estimated to have about 800 million documents [22], in which case
the above equation predicts ‹d›≈18.69. In other words in 1999 two randomly chosen
documents were on average 19 clicks from each other, a result that became known as 19
degrees of separation. Subsequent measurements on a sample of 200 million documents
found ‹d›≈16 [23], in good agreement with the ‹d›≈17 prediction. Currently the WWW is

estimated to have about trillion nodes (N~1012), in which case the formula predicts
‹d›≈25. Hence ‹d› is not fixed but as the network grows, so does the distance between
two documents.

  

The average path length of 25 is much larger than the proverbial six degrees (BOX 3.7).
The difference is easy to understand: The WWW has smaller average degree and larger
size than the social network. According to (3.19) both of these differences increase the
Web’s diameter.

In summary the small world property has not only ignited the public’s imagination (BOX 3.8),
but plays an important role in network science as well. The small world phenomena can be
reasonably well understood in the context of the random network model: It is rooted in the fact
that the number of nodes at distance d from a node increases exponentially with d. In the
coming chapters we will see that in real networks we encounter systematic deviations from
(3.19), forcing us to replace it with more accurate predictions. Yet the intuition offered by the
random network model on the origin of the small world phenomenon remains valid.

Six Degrees: Experimental Confirmation

The first empirical study of the small world phenomena took place in 1967, when Stanley
Milgram, building on the work of Pool and Kochen [20], designed an experiment to
measure the distances in social networks [24, 25]. Milgram chose a stock broker in Boston
and a divinity student in Sharon, Massachusetts as targets. He then randomly selected
residents of Wichita and Omaha, sending them a letter containing a short summary of the
study’s purpose, a photograph, the name, address and information about the target
person. They were asked to forward the letter to a friend, relative or acquantance who is
most likely to know the target person.

Within a few days the first letter arrived, passing through only two links. Eventually 64 of
the 296 letters made it back, some, however, requiring close to a dozen intermediates
[25]. These completed chains allowed Milgram to determine the number of individuals
required to get the letter to the target (Image 3.12a). He found that the median number of
intermediates was 5.2, a relatively small number that was remarkably close to Frigyes
Karinthy’s 1929 insight (BOX 3.8).

indicating that on average six ‘handshakes’ were required to get a letter to its recipient. The
playwright John Guare renamed this ‘six degrees of separation’ two decades later. After [25].

Milgram lacked an accurate map of the full acquaintance network, hence his experiment
could not detect the true distance between his study’s participants. Today Facebook has
the most extensive social network map ever assembled. Using Facebook’s social graph of
May 2011, consisting of 721 million active users and 68 billion symmetric friendship links,
researchers found an average distance 4.74 between the users (Image 3.12b). Therefore,
the study detected only ‘four degrees of separation’ [18], closer to the prediction of (3.20)
than to Milgram’s six degrees [24, 25].

Clustering Coefficient

The degree of a node contains no information about the relationship between a node's
neighbors. Do they all know each other, or are they perhaps isolated from each other? The
answer is provided by the local clustering coefficient Ci, that measures the density of links in
node i’s immediate neighborhood: Ci = 0 means that there are no links between i’s neighbors; Ci
= 1 implies that each of the i’s neighbors link to each other (SECTION 2.10).

To calculate Ci for a node in a random network we need to estimate the expected number of links
Li between the node’s ki neighbors. In a random network the probability that two of i’s
neighbors link to each other is p. As there are ki(ki - 1)/2 possible links between the ki neighbors
of node i, the expected value of Li is

Equation (3.21) makes two predictions:

  

•  For fixed ‹k›, the larger the network, the smaller is a node’s clustering coefficient.
Consequently a node's local clustering coefficient Ci is expected to decrease as 1/N. Note that the
network's average clustering coefficient, ‹C› also follows (3.21).
•  The local clustering coefficient of a node is independent of the node’s degree.

To test the validity of (3.21) we plot ‹C›/‹k› in function of N for several undirected networks
(Image 3.13a). We find that ‹C›/‹k› does not decrease as N-1, but it is largely independent of N,
in violation of the prediction (3.21) and point (1) above. In Image 3.13b-d we also show the
dependency of C on the node’s degree ki for three real networks, finding that C(k) systematically
decreases with the degree, again in violation of (3.21) and point (2).

In summary, we find that the random network model does not capture the clustering of real
networks. Instead real networks have a much higher clustering coefficient than expected for a
random network of similar N and L. An extension of the random network model proposed by
Watts and Strogatz [29] addresses the coexistence of high ‹C› and the small world property
(BOX 3.9). It fails to explain, however, why high-degree nodes have a smaller clustering
coefficient than low-degree nodes. Models explaining the shape of C(k) are discussed in Chapter
9.

Watts-Strogatz Model

Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz proposed an extension of the random network model
(Image 3.14) motivated by two observations [29]:

• Small World Property
In real networks the average distance between two nodes depends logarithmically on N
(3.18), rather than following a polynomial expected for regular lattices (Image 3.11).
• High Clustering
The average clustering coefficient of real networks is much higher than expected for a
random network of similar N and L (Image 3.13a).

The Watts-Strogatz model (also called the small-world model) interpolates between a regular
lattice, which has high clustering but lacks the small-world phenomenon, and a random
network, which has low clustering, but displays the small-world property (Image 3.14a-c).
Numerical simulations indicate that for a range of rewiring parameters the model's
average path length is low but the clustering coefficient is high, hence reproducing the
coexistence of high clustering and small-world phenomena (Image 3.14d).

Being an extension of the random network model, the Watts- Strogatz model predicts a
Poisson-like bounded degree distribution. Consequently high degree nodes, like those
seen in Image 3.6, are absent from it. Furthermore it predicts a k-independent C(k), being
unable to recover the k-dependence observed in Image 3.13b-d. As we show in the next
chapters, understanding the coexistence of the small world property with high clustering
must start from the network's correct degree distribution.

Summary: Real Networks are Not Random

Since its introduction in 1959 the random network model has dominated mathematical
approaches to complex networks. The model suggests that the random-looking networks
observed in complex systems should be described as purely random. With that it equated
complexity with randomness. We must therefore ask:

Do we really believe that real networks are random?

The answer is clearly no. As the interactions between our proteins are governed by the strict
laws of biochemistry, for the cell to function its chemical architecture cannot be random.
Similarly, in a random society an American student would be as likely to have among his friends
Chinese factory workers than one of her classmates.

In reality we suspect the existence of a deep order behind most complex systems. That order
must be reflected in the structure of the network that describes their architecture, resulting in
systematic deviations from a pure random configuration.

The degree to which random networks describe, or fail to describe, real systems, must not be
decided by epistemological arguments, but by a systematic quantitative comparison. We can do
this, taking advantage of the fact that random network theory makes a number of quantitative
predictions:

Degree Distribution
A random network has a binomial distribution, well approximated by a Poisson distribution in
the k « N limit. Yet, as shown in Image 3.5, the Poisson distribution fails to capture the degree
distribution of real networks. In real systems we have more highly connected nodes than the
random network model could account for.

Random network theory predicts that for ‹k› › 1 we should observe a giant component, a
by Albert-László Barabási
condition satisfied by all networks we examined. Most networks, however, do not satisfy the ‹k›
› lnN condition, implying that they should be broken into isolated clusters (Table 3.1). Some
networks are indeed fragmented, most are not.

Average Path Length
Random network theory predicts that the average path length follows (3.19), a prediction that
offers a reasonable approximation for the observed path lengths. Hence the random network
model can account for the emergence of small world phenomena.

Clustering Coefficient
In a random network the local clustering coefficient is independent of the node’s degree and ‹C›
depends on the system size as 1/N. In contrast, measurements indicate that for real networks
C(k) decreases with the node degrees and is largely independent of the system size (Image 3.13).

Taken together, it appears that the small world phenomena is the only property reasonably
explained by the random network model. All other network characteristics, from the degree
distribution to the clustering coefficient, are significantly different in real networks. The
extension of the Erdős-Rényi model proposed by Watts and Strogatz successfully predicts the
coexistence of high C and low ‹d›, but fails to explain the degree distribution and C(k). In fact,
the more we learn about real networks, the more we will arrive at the startling conclusion that
we do not know of any real network that is accurately described by the random network model.

This conclusion begs a legitimate question: If real networks are not random, why did we devote a
full chapter to the random network model? The answer is simple: The model serves as an
important reference as we proceed to explore the properties of real networks. Each time we
observe some network property we will have to ask if it could have emerged by chance. For this
we turn to the random network model as a guide: If the property is present in the model, it
means that randomness can account for it. If the property is absent in random networks, it may
represent some signature of order, requiring a deeper explanation. So, the random network
model may be the wrong model for most real systems, but it remains quite relevant for network
science (BOX 3.10).

Box 3.10

Random Networks and Network Science

The lack of agreement between random and real networks raises an important question:
How could a theory survive so long given its poor agreement with reality? The answer is
simple: Random network theory was never meant to serve as a model of real systems.

Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási

Erdős and Rényi write in their first paper [2] that random networks “may be interesting
not only from a purely mathematical point of view. In fact, the evolution of graphs may be
considered as a rather simplified model of the evolution of certain communication nets
(railways, road or electric network systems, etc.) of a country or some unit.” Yet, in the
string of eight papers authored by them on the subject [2-9], this is the only mention of
the potential practical value of their approach. The subsequent development of random
graphs was driven by the problem's inherent mathematical challenges, rather than its
applications.

  

It is tempting to follow Thomas Kuhn and view network science as a paradigm change
from random graphs to a theory of real networks [30]. In reality, there was no network
paradigm before the end of 1990s. This period is characterized by a lack of systematic
attempts to compare the properties of real networks with graph theoretical models. The
work of Erdős and Rényi has gained prominence outside mathematics only after the
emergence of network science (Image 3.15).

Network theory does not lessen the contributions of Erdős and Rényi, but celebrates the
unintended impact of their work. When we discuss the disrepacies between random and
real networks, we do so mainly for pedagogical reasons: to offer a proper foundation on
which we can understand the properties of real systems.

Network Science and Random Networks
While today we perceive the Erdős-Rényi model as the cornerstone of network theory, the model
was hardly known outside a small subﬁeld of mathematics. This is illustrated by the yearly

Minimum and Maximum Degree
The estimated maximum degree of a network, kmax, is chosen so that there is at most one node whose
degree is higher than kmax. This is often called the natural upper cutoff of a degree distribution. To
calculate it, we need to set kmax such that the area under the degree distribution pk for k > kmax equals
1/N, hence the total number of nodes expected in this region is exactly one. We follow a similar
argument to determine the expected smallest degree, kmin.

Giant Component

In this section we introduce the argument, proposed independently by Solomonoff and Rapoport
[11], and by Erdős and Rényi [2], for the emergence of giant component at 〈k〉= 1 [33].

Let us denote with u = 1 - NG/N the fraction of nodes that are not in the giant component (GC),
whose size we take to be NG. If node i is part of the GC, it must link to another node j, which must
also be part of the GC. Hence if i is not part of the GC, that could happen for two reasons:

•  There is no link between i and j (probability for this is 1- p).
•  There is a link between i and j, but j is not part of the GC (probability for this is pu).

S = 1 −
This equation provides the size of the giant component S in function of 〈k〉 (Image 3.18). While
(3.32) looks simple, it does not have a closed solution. We can solve it graphically by plotting the
right hand side of (3.32) as a function of S for various values of 〈k〉. To have a nonzero solution,
the obtained curve must intersect with the dotted diagonal, representing the left hand side of
(3.32). For small 〈k〉 the two curves intersect each other only at S = 0, indicating that for small 〈k〉
the size of the giant component is zero. Only when 〈k〉 exceeds a threshold value, does a non-
zero solution emerge.

To determine the value of 〈k〉 at which we start having a nonzero solution we take a derivative of
(3.32), as the phase transition point is when the r.h.s. of (3.32) has the same derivative as the

In Image 3.7 we explored the size of the giant component, leaving an important question open:
How many components do we expect for a given ‹k›? What is their size distribution? The aim of
this section is to discuss these topics.

Component Size Distribution

Therefore the component size distribution has two contributions: a slowly decreasing power law
term s-3/2 and a rapidly decreasing exponential term e-(‹k›-1)s+(s-1)ln‹k›. Given that the
exponential term dominates for large s, (3.35) predicts that large components are prohibited. At
the critical point, ‹k› = 1, all terms in the exponential cancel, hence ps follows the power law

As a power law decreases relatively slowly, at the critical point we expect to observe clusters of
widely different sizes, a property consistent with the behavior of a system during a phase
transition (ADVANCED TOPICS 3.F). These predictions are supported by the numerical
simulations shown in Image 3.19.

This is a biased measure, as the chance of belonging to a larger cluster is higher than the chance

To determine the value of ‹k› at which most nodes became part of the giant component, we
calculate the probability that a randomly selected node does not have a link to the giant

component, which is (1-p)NG≈(1-p)N , as in this regime NG ≃ N. The expected number of such

we arrive to the point where only one node is disconnected from the giant component. At this
point IN = 1, hence according to (3.40) p needs to satisfy Ne-Np=1 . Consequently, the value of p at

Phase Transitions

The emergence of the giant component at ‹k›=1 in the random network model is reminiscent of
a phase transition, a much studied phenomenon in physics and chemistry [35]. Consider two
examples:

•  Water-Ice Transition (Image 3.21a): At high temperatures the H2O molecules engage in a
diffusive motion, forming small groups and then breaking apart to group up with other water
molecules. If cooled, at 0˚C the molecules suddenly stop this diffusive dance, forming an
ordered rigid ice crystal.
•  Magnetism (Image 3.21b): In ferromagnetic metals like iron at high temperatures the spins
point in randomly chosen directions. Under some critical temperature Tc all atoms orient their
spins in the same direction and the metal turns into a magnet.

The freezing of a liquid and the emergence of magnetization are examples of phase transitions,
representing transitions from disorder to order. Indeed, relative to the perfect order of the
crystalline ice, liquid water is rather disordered. Similarly, the randomly oriented spins in a
ferromagnet take up the highly ordered common orientation under Tc.

Many properties of a system undergoing a phase transition are universal. This means that the
same quantitative patterns are observed in a wide range of systems, from magma freezing into
rock to a ceramic material turning into a superconductor. Furthermore, near the phase
transition point, called the critical point, many quantities of interest follow power-laws.

The phenomena observed near the critical point ‹k› = 1 in a random network in many ways is
similar to a phase transition:

•  The similarity between Image 3.7a and the magnetization diagram of Image 3.21b is not
accidental: they both show a transition from disorder to order. In random networks this
corresponds to the emergence of a giant component when ‹k› exceeds ‹k› = 1.
•  As we approach the freezing point, ice crystals of widely different sizes are observed, and so
are domains of atoms with spins pointing in the same direction. The size distribution of the ice
crystals or magnetic domains follows a power law. Similarly, while for ‹k› ‹ 1 and ‹k› › 1 the
cluster sizes follow an exponential distribution, right at the phase transition point ps follows the
power law (3.36), indicating the coexistence of components of widely different sizes.
•  At the critical point the average size of the ice crystals or of the magnetic domains diverges,

In ferromagnetic materials the magnetic moments of the individual atoms (spins) can point in two
different directions. At high temperatures they choose randomly their direction (right panel). In this
disordered state the system’s total magnetization (m = ΔM/N, where ΔM is the number of up spins minus
the number of down spins) is zero. The phase diagram (middle panel) indicates that by lowering the
temperature T, the system undergoes a phase transition at T= Tc, when a nonzero magnetization
emerges. Lowering T further allows m to converge to one. In this ordered phase all spins point in the
same direction (left panel).

Small World Corrections

Equation (3.18) offers only an approximation to the network diameter, valid for very large N and
small d. Indeed, as soon as ‹k›d approaches the system size N the ‹k›d scaling must break down,
as we do not have enough nodes to continue the ‹k›d expansion. Such finite size effects result in
corrections to (3.18). For a random network with average degree ‹k›, the network diameter is
better approximated by [36]

dmax

ln N
ln⟨k⟩

+

2 ln N

ln[−W(⟨k⟩ exp −⟨k⟩)]

(3. 42)

where the Lambert W-function W(z) is the principal inverse of f(z) = z exp(z). The first term on
the r.h.s is (3.18), while the second is the correction that depends on the average degree. The
correction increases the diameter, accounting for the fact that when we approach the network’s
diameter the number of nodes must grow slower than ‹k›. The magnitude of the correction
becomes more obvious if we consider the various limits of (3.42).

In the ‹k› → 1 limit we can calculate the Lambert W-function, finding for the diameter [36]

dmax

= 3

ln N
ln⟨k⟩

(3. 43)

Hence in the moment when the giant component emerges the network diameter is three times
our prediction (3.18). This is due to the fact that at the critical point ‹k› = 1 the network has a
tree-like structure, consisting of long chains with hardly any loops, a configuration that
increases dmax.

In the ‹k› → ∞ limit, corresponding to a very dense network, (3.42) becomes

Section 4.1

Introduction

The World Wide Web is a network whose nodes are documents and the links are the uniform
resource locators (URLs) that allow us to “surf” with a click from one web document to the
other. With an estimated size of over one trillion documents (N≈1012), the Web is the largest
network humanity has ever built. It exceeds in size even the human brain (N ≈ 1011 neurons).

It is difficult to overstate the importance of the World Wide Web in our daily life. Similarly, we
cannot exaggerate the role the WWW played in the development of network theory: it facilitated
the discovery of a number of fundamental network characteristics and became a standard
testbed for most network measures.

We can use a software called a crawler to map out the Web’s wiring diagram. A crawler can start
from any web document, identifying the links (URLs) on it. Next it downloads the documents
these links point to and identifies the links on these documents, and so on. This process
iteratively returns a local map of the Web. Search engines like Google or Bing operate crawlers to
find and index new documents and to maintain a detailed map of the WWW.

The first map of the WWW obtained with the explicit goal of understanding the structure of the
network behind it was generated by Hawoong Jeong at University of Notre Dame. He mapped out
the nd.edu domain [1], consisting of about 300,000 documents and 1.5 million links (Video 4.1).
The purpose of the map was to compare the properties of the Web graph to the random network
model. Indeed, in 1998 there were reasons to believe that the WWW could be well approximated
by a random network. The content of each document reflects the personal and professional
interests of its creator, from individuals to organizations. Given the diversity of these interests,
the links on these documents might appear to point to randomly chosen documents

Video 4.1
Zooming into the World Wide Web Watch an online video that zooms into the WWW sample that has lead
to the discovery of the scale-free property [1]. This is the network featured in Table 2.1 and shown in
Image 4.1, whose characteristics are tested throughout this book.

A quick look at the map in Image 4.1 supports this view: There appears to be considerable
randomness behind the Web’s wiring diagram. Yet, a closer inspection reveals some puzzling
differences between this map and a random network. Indeed, in a random network highly
connected nodes, or hubs, are effectively forbidden. In contrast in Image 4.1 numerous small-
degree nodes coexist with a few hubs, nodes with an exceptionally large number of links

In this chapter we show that hubs are not unique to the Web, but we encounter them in most
real networks. They represent a signature of a deeper organizing principle that we call the scale-
free property. We therefore explore the degree distribution of real networks, which allows us to
uncover and characterize scale-free network. The analytical and empirical results discussed here
represent the foundations of the modeling efforts the rest of this book is based on. Indeed, we
will come to see that no matter what network property we are interested in, from communities
to spreading processes, it must be inspected in the light of the network’s degree distribution.

Power Laws and Scale-Free Networks

If the WWW were to be a random network, the degrees of the Web documents should follow a
Poisson distribution. Yet, as Image 4.2 indicates, the Poisson form offers a poor fit for the
WWW’s degree distribution. Instead on a log-log scale the data points form an approximate
straight line, suggesting that the degree distribution of the WWW is well approximated with

∼

k−γ

(4. 1)

pk
Equation (4.1) is called a power law distribution and the exponent γ is its degree exponent (BOX 4.1).
If we take a logarithm of (4.1), we obtain

pk

∼ −γ log k

log
If (4.1) holds, log pk is expected to depend linearly on log k, the slope of this line being the degree
exponent γ (Image 4.2).

The Degree Distribution of the WWW
The incoming (a) and outgoing (b) degree distribution of the WWW sample mapped in the 1999 study of
Albert et al. [1]. The degree distribution is shown on double logarithmic axis (log-log plot), in which a
power law follows a straight line. The symbols correspond to the empirical data and the line corresponds
to the power-law ﬁt, with degree exponents γin= 2.1 and γout = 2.45. We also show as a green line the
degree distribution predicted by a Poisson function with the average degree 〈kin〉 = 〈kout〉 = 4.60 of the
WWW sample.

The WWW is a directed network, hence each document is characterized by an out-degree kout,
representing the number of links that point from the document to other documents, and an in-
degree kin, representing the number of other documents that point to the selected document. We
must therefore distinguish two degree distributions: the probability that a randomly chosen
document points to kout web documents, or pkout , and the probability that a randomly chosen
node has kin web documents pointing to it, or pkin . In the case of the WWW both pkin and pkout
can be approximated by a power law

We will call such networks scale-free, defined as [2]:

A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law.

As Image 4.2 indicates, for the WWW the power law persists for almost four orders of
magnitude, prompting us to call the Web graph scale-free network. In this case the scale-free
property applies to both in and out-degrees.

To better understand the scale-free property, we have to define the power-law distribution in
more precise terms. Therefore next we discuss the discrete and the continuum formalisms used
throughout this book.

Discrete Formalism

As node degrees are positive integers, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., the discrete formalism provides the
probability pk that a node has exactly k links

The constant C is determined by the normalization condition

where ζ (γ) is the Riemann-zeta function. Thus for k > 0 the discrete power-law distribution has
the form

Note that (4.8) diverges at k=0. If needed, we can separately specify p0, representing the fraction
of nodes that have no links to other nodes. In that case the calculation of C in (4.7) needs to
incorporate p0.

Continuum Formalism
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
In analytical calculations it is often convenient to assume that the degrees can have any positive
real value. In this case we write the power-law degree distribution as

(4. 11)

Therefore in the continuum formalism the degree distribution has the form

p(k) = (γ − 1)
Here kmin is the smallest degree for which the power law (4.8) holds

(4. 12)

kγ−1
min k−γ

Note that pk encountered in the discrete formalism has a precise meaning: it is the probability
that a randomly selected node has degree k. In contrast, only the integral of p(k) encountered in
the continuum formalism has a physical interpretation:

p(k)dk

k2
∫
k1
is the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree between k1 and k2.

(4. 13)

In summary, networks whose degree distribution follows a power law are called scale-free
networks. If a network is directed, the scale-free property applies separately to the in- and the
out-degrees. To mathematically study the properties of scale-free networks, we can use either
the discrete or the continuum formalism. The scale-free property is independent of the
formalism we use.

Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto (1848 – 1923)
Italian economist, political scientist, and philosopher, who had important contributions to our
understanding of income distribution and to the analysis of individual choices. A number of
fundamental principles are named after him, like Pareto efﬁciency, Pareto distribution (another
name for a power-law distribution), the Pareto principle (or 80/20 law).

Box 4.1

The 80/20 Rule and the Top One Percent

Vilfredo Pareto, a 19th century economist, noticed that in Italy a few wealthy individuals
earned most of the money, while the majority of the population earned rather small
amounts. He connected this disparity to the observation that incomes follow a power law,
representing the first known report of a power-law distribution [3]. His finding entered
the popular literature as the 80/20 rule: Roughly 80 percent of money is earned by only 20
percent of the population.

The 80/20 rule emerges in many areas. For example in management it is often stated that
80 percent of profits are produced by only 20 percent of the employees. Similarly, 80
percent of decisions are made during 20 percent of meeting time.

The 80/20 rule is present in networks as well: 80 percent of links on the Web point to only
15 percent of webpages; 80 percent of citations go to only 38 percent of scientists; 80
percent of links in Hollywood are connected to 30 percent of actors [4]. Most quantities
following a power law distribution obey the 80/20 rule.

During the 2009 economic crisis power laws gained a new meaning: The Occupy Wall
Street Movement draw attention to the fact that in the US 1% of the population earns a
disproportionate 15% of the total US income. This 1% phenomena, a signature of a
profound income disparity, is again a consequence of the power-law nature of the income
distribution.

  

•  For small k the power law is above the Poisson function, indicating tha t a scale-free network
has a large number of small degree nodes, most of which are absent in a random network.
•  For k in the vicinity of 〈k〉 the Poisson distribution is above the power law, indicating that in a
random network there is an excess of nodes with degree k≈〈k〉.
•  For large k the power law is again above the Poisson curve. The difference is particularly
visible if we show pk on a log-log plot (Image 4.4b), indicating that the probability of observing a
high-degree node, or hub, is several orders of magnitude higher in a scale-free than in a random
network.

Let us use the WWW to illustrate the magnitude of these differences. The probability to have a
node with k=100 is about p100≈10−94 in a Poisson distribution while it is about p100≈4x10-4 if pk
follows a power law. Consequently, if the WWW were to be a random network with ‹k›=4.6 and

degree k ≥100.

finite. Other networks pale in comparison: The genetic network in a human cell has
by Albert-László Barabási
approximately 20,000 genes while the metabolic network of the E. Coli bacteria has only about a
thousand metabolites. This prompts us to ask: How does the network size affect the size of its
hubs? To answer this we calculate the maximum degree, kmax, called the natural cutoff of the
degree distribution pk. It represents the expected size of the largest hub in a network.

It is instructive to perform the calculation first for the exponential distribution

p(k) = Ce−λk
For a network with minimum degree kmin the normalization condition

provides C = λeλkmin. To calculate kmax we assume that in a network of N nodes we expect at most
one node in the (kmax, ∞) regime (ADVANCED TOPICS 3.B). In other words the probability to
observe a node whose degree exceeds kmax is 1/N:

kmax
As lnN is a slow function of the system size, (4.17) tells us that the maximum degree will not be
significantly different from kmin. For a Poisson degree distribution the calculation is a bit more
involved, but the obtained dependence of kmax on N is even slower than the logarithmic
dependence predicted by (4.17) (ADVANCED TOPICS 3.B).

For a scale-free network, according to (4.12) and (4.16), the natural cutoff follows

kmax
Hence the larger a network, the larger is the degree of its biggest hub. The polynomial
dependence of kmax on N implies that in a large scale-free network there can be orders of
magnitude differences in size between the smallest node, kmin, and the biggest hub, kmax (Image
4.5).

same average degree 〈k〉= 3. For the scale-free network we chose γ = 2.5. For comparison, we also show
the linear behavior, kmax ~ N − 1, expected for a complete network. Overall, hubs in a scale-free network
are several orders of magnitude larger than the biggest node in a random network with the same N and
〈k〉

To illustrate the difference in the maximum degree of an exponential and a scale-free network
let us return to the WWW sample of Image 4.1, consisting of N ≈ 3 × 105 nodes. As kmin = 1, if the
degree distribution were to follow an exponential, (4.17) predicts that the maximum degree
should be kmax ≈ 14 for λ=1. In a scale-free network of similar size and γ = 2.1, (4.18) predicts kmax
≈ 95,000, a remarkable difference. Note that the largest in-degree of the WWW map of Image
4.1 is 10,721, which is comparable to kmax predicted by a scale-free network. This reinforces our
conclusion that in a random network hubs are effectivelly forbidden, while in scale-free networks they
are naturally present.

In summary the key difference between a random and a scale-free network is rooted in the
different shape of the Poisson and of the power-law function: In a random network most nodes
have comparable degrees and hence hubs are forbidden. Hubs are not only tolerated, but are
expected in scale-free networks (Image 4.6). Furthermore, the more nodes a scalefree network

Random vs. Scale-free Networks
•  The degrees of a random network follow a Poisson distribution, rather similar to a bell curve.
Therefore most nodes have comparable degrees and nodes with a large number of links are absent.
•  A random network looks a bit like the national highway network in which nodes are cities and links are
the major highways. There are no cities with hundreds of highways and no city is disconnected from the
highway system.
•  In a network with a power-law degree distribution most nodes have only a few links. These numerous
small nodes are held together by a few highly connected hubs.
•  A scale-free network looks like the air-trafﬁc network, whose nodes are airports and links are the
direct ﬂights between them. Most airports are tiny, with only a few ﬂights. Yet, we have a few very large
airports, like Chicago or Los Angeles, that act as major hubs, connecting many smaller airports.

The Meaning of Scale-Free

The term “scale-free” is rooted in a branch of statistical physics called the theory of phase
transitions that extensively explored power laws in the 1960s and 1970s (ADVANCED TOPICS 3.F).
To best understand the meaning of the scale-free term, we need to familiarize ourselves with
the moments of the degree distribution.

The nth moment of the degree distribution is defined as

⟨
kn

⟩ =

knpk

≈

kn

p(k)dk

(4. 19)

∞
∑
kmin

∞
∫
kmin

The lower moments have important interpretation:

• n=1: The first moment is the average degree, 〈k〉.
• n=2: The second moment, 〈k2〉, helps us calculate the variance σ2 = 〈k2〉 − 〈k〉2, measuring the
spread in the degrees. Its square root, σ, is the standard deviation.
• n=3: The third moment, 〈k3〉, determines the skewness of a distribution, telling us how
symmetric is pk around the average 〈k〉.

For a scale-free network the nth moment of the degree distribution is

⟨
kn

⟩ =

kn

p(k)dk = C

kn−γ+1
max

kn−γ+1
−
min
n−γ+1

kmax
∫
kmin

(4. 20)

While typically kmin is fixed, the degree of the largest hub, kmax, increases with the system size,
following (4.18). Hence to understand the behavior of 〈kn〉 we need to take the asymptotic limit
kmax → ∞ in (4.20), probing the properties of very large networks. In this limit (4.20) predicts
that the value of 〈kn〉 depends on the interplay between n and γ:

•  If n −γ + 1 ≤ 0 then the first term on the r.h.s. of (4.20), kmax
increases. Therefore all moments that satisfy n ≤ γ−1 are finite.
•  If n−γ+1 > 0 then 〈kn〉 goes to infinity as kmax→∞. Therefore all moments larger than γ−1
diverge.

n−γ+1, goes to zero as kmax

these in the N → ∞ limit the first moment 〈k〉 is finite, but the second and higher moments,〈kn〉,

Indeed, if the degrees follow a normal distribution, then the degree of a randomly chosen node
is typically in the range

Yet, the average degree ‹k› and the standard deviation σk have rather different magnitude in
random and in scale-free networks:

•  Random Networks Have a Scale
For a random network with a Poisson degree distribution σk = ‹k›1/2, which is always smaller
than 〈k〉. Hence the network’s nodes have degrees in the range k = 〈k〉 ± 〈k〉1/2. In other words
nodes in a random network have comparable degrees and the average degree 〈k〉 serves as the
“scale” of a random network.
•  Scale-free Networks Lack a Scale
For a network with a power-law degree distribution with γ < 3 the first moment is finite but the
second moment is infinite. The divergence of 〈k2〉 (and of σk) for large N indicates that the
fluctuations around the average can be arbitrary large. This means that when we randomly
choose a node, we do not know what to expect: The selected node’s degree could be tiny or
arbitrarily large. Hence networks with γ ‹ 3 do not have a meaningful internal scale, but are
“scale-free” (Image 4.7).
For example the average degree of the WWW sample is 〈k〉 = 4.60 (Table 4.1). Given that γ ≈ 2.1,
the second moment diverges, which means that our expectation for the in-degree of a randomly
chosen WWW document is k=4.60 ± ∞ in the N → ∞ limit. That is, a randomly chosen web
document could easily yield a document of degree one or two, as 74.02% of nodes have in-degree
less than 〈k〉. Yet, it could also yield a node with hundreds of millions of links, like google.com or
facebook.com.

Lack of an Internal Scale
For any exponentially bounded distribution, like a Poisson or a Gaussian, the degree of a randomly
chosen node is in the vicinity of 〈k〉. Hence 〈k〉 serves as the network’s scale. For a power law
distribution the second moment can diverge, and the degree of a randomly chosen node can be
signiﬁcantly different from 〈k〉. Hence 〈k〉 does not serve as an intrinsic scale. As a network with a power
law degree distribution lacks an intrinsic scale, we

Strictly speaking 〈k2〉 diverges only in the N → ∞ limit. Yet, the divergence is relevant for finite
networks as well. To illustrate this, Table 4.1 lists 〈k2〉 and Image 4.8 shows the standard
deviation σ for ten real networks. For most of these networks σ is significantly larger than 〈k〉,
documenting large variations in node degrees. For example, the degree of a randomly chosen
node in the WWW sample is kin = 4.60 ± 1546, indicating once again that the average is not
informative.

In summary, the scale-free name captures the lack of an internal scale, a consequence of the
fact that nodes with widely different degrees coexist in the same network. This feature
distinguishes scale-free networks from lattices, in which all nodes have exactly the same degree

connected hubs hold together numerous small nodes.

different systems. The WWW is an information network, whose nodes are documents and links

called routers and whose links correspond to physical connections, like copper and optical
cables or wireless links.

In the past decade many real networks of major scientific, technological and societal importance
were found to display the scale-free property. This is illustrated in Image 4.10, where we show
the degree distribution of an infrastructural network (Internet), a biological network (protein
interactions), a communication network (emails) and a network characterizing scientific
communications (citations). For each network the degree distribution significantly deviates
from a Poisson distribution, being better approximated with a power law.

The diversity of the systems that share the scale-free property is remarkable (BOX 4.2). Indeed,
the WWW is a man-made network with a history of little more than two decades, while the
protein interaction network is the product of four billion years of evolution. In some of these
networks the nodes are molecules, in others they are computers. It is this diversity that prompts
us to call the scale-free property a universal network characteristic.

In each panel the green dotted line shows the Poisson distribution with the same 〈k〉 as the real
network, illustrating that the random network model cannot account for the observed pk. For directed
networks we show separately the incoming and outgoing degree distributions.

From the perspective of a researcher, a crucial question is the following: How do we know if a
network is scale-free? On one end, a quick look at the degree distribution will immediately
reveal whether the network could be scale-free: In scale-free networks the degrees of the
smallest and the largest nodes are widely different, often spanning several orders of magnitude.
In contrast, these nodes have comparable degrees in a random network. As the value of the
degree exponent plays an important role in predicting various network properties, we need tools
to fit the pk distribution and to estimate γ. This prompts us to address several issues pertaining
to plotting and fitting power laws:

Plotting the Degree Distribution

The degree distributions shown in this chapter are plotted on a double logarithmic scale, often
called a log-log plot. The main reason is that when we have nodes with widely different degrees,
a linear plot is unable to display them all. To obtain the clean-looking degree distributions
shown throughout this book we use logarithmic binning, ensuring that each datapoint has
sufficient number of observations behind it. The practical tips for plotting a network’s degree
distribution are discussed in ADVANCED TOPICS 4.B.

Measuring the Degree Exponent

A quick estimate of the degree exponent can be obtained by fitting a straight line to pk on a log-
log plot.Yet, this approach can be affected by systematic biases, resulting in an incorrect γ. The
statistical tools available to estimate γ are discussed in ADVANCED TOPICS 4.C.

The Shape of pk for Real Networks

Many degree distributions observed in real networks deviate from a pure power law. These
deviations can be attributed to data incompleteness or data collection biases, but can also carry
important information about processes that contribute to the emergence of a particular

In summary, since the 1999 discovery of the scale-free nature of the WWW, a large number of
real networks of scientific and technological interest have been found to be scale-free, from
biological to social and linguistic networks (BOX 4.2). This does not mean that all networks are
scalefree. Indeed, many important networks, from the power grid to networks observed in
materials science, do not display the scale-free property (BOX 4.3).

For the scale-free property to emerge the nodes need to have the capacity to link to an
arbitrary number of other nodes. These links do not need to be concurrent: We do not
constantly chat with each of our acquaintances and a protein in the cell does not
simultaneously bind to each of its potential interaction partners. The scalefree property is
absent in systems that limit the number of links a node can have, effectively restricting
the maximum size of the hubs. Such limitations are common in materials (Image 4.11),
explaining why they cannot develop a scale-free topology.

Ultra-Small Property

The presence of hubs in scale-free networks raises an interesting question: Do hubs affect the
small world property? Image 4.4 suggests that they do: Airlines build hubs precisely to decrease
the number of hops between two airports. The calculations support this expectation, finding
that distances in a scale-free network are smaller than the distances observed in an equivalent random
network.

The dependence of the average distance 〈d〉 on the system size N and the degree exponent γ are
captured by the formula [29, 30]

Anomalous Regime (γ = 2)
According to (4.18) for γ = 2 the degree of the biggest hub grows linearly with the system size,
i.e. kmax ~ N. This forces the network into a hub and spoke configuration in which all nodes are
close to each other because they all connect to the same central hub. In this regime the average
path length does not depend on N.

regime ultra-small, as the hubs radically reduce the path length [29]. They do so by linking to a
large number of small-degree nodes, creating short distances between them. To see the
implication of the ultra-small world property consider again the world’s social network with N ≈
7x109. If the society is described by a random network, the N-dependent term is lnNN = 22.66. In

change visibly with γ.

The networks were generated using the static model [32] with 〈k〉 = 3.

Critical Point (γ = 3)

This value is of particular theoretical interest, as the second moment of the degree distribution
does not diverge any longer. We therefore call γ = 3 the critical point. At this critical point the lnN
dependence encountered for random networks returns. Yet, the calculations indicate the
presence of a double logarithmic correction lnlnN [29, 31], which shrinks the distances
compared to a random network of similar size.

Small World (γ > 3)

In this regime 〈k2〉 is finite and the average distance follows the small world result derived for
random networks. While hubs continue to be present, for γ > 3 they are not sufficiently large and
numerous to have a significant impact on the distance between the nodes.

Taken together, (4.22) indicates that the more pronounced the hubs are, the more effectively
they shrink the distances between nodes. This conclusion is supported by Image 4.12a, which
shows the scaling of the average path length for scale-free networks with different γ. The figure
indicates that while for small N the distances in the four regimes are comparable, for large N we
observe remarkable differences.

Further support is provided by the path length distribution for scale-free networks with
different γ and N (Image 4.12b-d). For N = 102 the path length distributions overlap, indicating
that at this size differences in γ result in undetectable differences in the path length. For N =
106, however, pd observed for different γ are well separated. Image 4.12d also shows that the
larger the degree exponent, the larger are the distances between the nodes.

In summary the scale-free property has several effects on network distances:

•  Shrinks the average path lengths. Therefore most scale-free networks of practical interest are
not only “small”, but are “ultra-small”. This is a consequence of the hubs, that act as bridges
between many small degree nodes.

Box 4.4

We Are Always Close to the Hubs

Frigyes Karinthy in his 1929 short story [33] that first described the small world concept
cautions that “it’s always easier to find someone who knows a famous or popular figure
than some run-the-mill, insignificant person”. In other words, we are typically closer to
hubs than to less connected nodes. This effect is particularly pronounced in scale-free
networks (Image 4.13).

The implications are obvious: There are always short paths linking us to famous
individuals like well known scientists or the president of the United States, as they are
hubs with an exceptional number of acquaintances. It also means that many of the
shortest paths go through these hubs.

In contrast to this expectation, measurements aiming to replicate the six degrees concept
in the online world find that individuals involved in chains that reached their target were
less likely to send a message to a hub than individuals involved in incomplete chains [34].
The reason may be self-imposed: We perceive hubs as being busy, so we contact them

Closing on the hubs
The distance 〈dtarget〉 of a node with degree k ≈ 〈k〉 to a target node with degree ktarget in a
random and a scale-free network. In scale-free networks we are closer to the hubs than in
random networks. The ﬁgure also illustrates that in a random network the largest-degree nodes
are considerably smaller and hence the path lengths are visibly longer than in a scale-free
network. Both networks have 〈k〉 = 2 and N = 1,000 and for the scale-free network we choose γ =
2.5.

Section 4.7

The Role of the Degree Exponent
Many properties of a scale-free network depend on the value of the degree exponent γ. A close
inspection of Table 4.1 indicates that:

•  γ varies from system to system, prompting us to explore how the properties of a network
change with γ.
•  For most real systems the degree exponent is above 2, making us wonder: Why don’t we see
networks with γ ‹ 2?

The γ Dependent Properties of Scale-Free Networks

Anomalous Regime (γ≤ 2)
For γ ‹ 2 the exponent 1/(γ− 1) in (4.18) is larger than one, hence the number of links connected
to the largest hub grows faster than the size of the network. This means that for sufficiently
large N the degree of the largest hub must exceed the total number of nodes in the network,
hence it will run out of nodes to connect to. Similarly, for γ ‹ 2 the average degree 〈k〉 diverges in
the N → ∞ limit. These odd predictions are only two of the many anomalous features of scale-
free networks in this regime. They are signatures of a deeper problem: Large scale-free network

Scale-Free Regime (2 ‹ γ ‹ 3)

  

In this regime the first moment of the degree distribution is finite but the second and higher
moments diverge as N → ∞. Consequently scalefree networks in this regime are ultra-small
(SECTION 4.6). Equation (4.18) predicts that kmax grows with the size of the network with
exponent 1/(γ - 1), which is smaller than one. Hence the market share of the largest hub, kmax
/N, representing the fraction of nodes that connect to it, decreases as kmax/N ~ N-(γ-2)/(γ-1).

As we will see in the coming chapters, many interesting features of scale-free networks, from
their robustness to anomalous spreading phenomena, are linked to this regime.

Random Network Regime (γ › 3)
According to (4.20) for γ > 3 both the first and the second moments are finite. For all practical
purposes the properties of a scale-free network in this regime are difficult to distinguish from
the properties a random network of similar size. For example (4.22) indicates that the average
distance between the nodes converges to the small-world formula derived for random networks.
The reason is that for large γ the degree distribution pk decays sufficiently fast to make the hubs
small and less numerous.

Note that scale-free networks with large γ are hard to distinguish from a random network.
Indeed, to document the presence of a power-law degree distribution we ideally need 2-3 orders
of magnitude of scaling, which means that kmax should be at least 102 - 103 times larger than
kmin. By inverting (4.18) we can estimate the network size necessary to observe the desired
scaling regime, finding

γ−1

N =
For example, if we wish to document the scale-free nature of a network with γ = 5 and require

scaling that spans at least two orders of magnitudes (e.g. kmin ~ 1 and kmax ≃ 102), according to

(4. 23)

(4.23) the size of the network must exceed N > 108. There are very few network maps of this size.
Therefore, there may be many networks with large degree exponent. Given, however, their
limited size, it is difficult to obtain convincing evidence of their scale-free nature.

In summary, we find that the behavior of scale-free networks is sensitive to the value of the
degree exponent γ. Theoretically the most interesting regime is 2 ‹ γ ‹ 3, where 〈k2〉 diverges,
making scale-free networks ultra-small. Interestingly, many networks of practical interest,
from the WWW to protein interaction networks, are in this regime.

Why Scale-Free Networks With γ ‹ 2 Do Not Exist
To see why networks with γ ‹ 2 are problematic, we need to attempt to build one. A degree
sequence that can be turned into simple graph (i.e. a graph lacking multi-links or self-
loops) is called graphical [35]. Yet, not all degree sequences are graphical: For example, if
the number of stubs is odd, then we will always have an unmatched stub (Image 4.14b).

The graphicality of a degree sequence can be tested with an algorithm proposed by Erdős
and Gallai [35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. If we apply the algorithm to scale-free networks we find
that the number of graphical degree sequences drops to zero for γ ‹ 2 (Image 4.14c). Hence
degree distributions with γ ‹ 2 cannot be turned into simple networks. Indeed, for
networks in this regime the largest hub grows faster than N. If we do not allow self-loops
and multi-links, then the largest hub will run out of nodes to connect to once its degree
exceeds N − 1.

Image 4.14
Networks With γ ‹ 2 are Not Graphical
•  Degree distributions and the corresponding degree sequences for two small networks. The
difference between them is in the degree of a single node. While we can build a simple network
using the degree distribution (a), it is impossible to build one using (b), as one stub always
remains unmatched. Hence (a) is graphical, while (b) is not.
•  Fraction of networks, g, for a given γ that are graphical. A large number of degree sequences
with degree exponent γ and N = 105 were generated, testing the graphicality of each network.
The ﬁgure indicates that while virtually all networks with γ › 2 are graphical, it is impossible to ﬁnd
graphical networks in the 0 ‹ γ ‹ 2 range. After [39].

•  Assign a degree to each node, represented as stubs or half-links. The degree sequence is either
Network Science
generated analytically from a preselected pk distribution (BOX 4.7), or it is extracted from the adjacency
by Albert-László Barabási
matrix of a real network. We must start from an even number of stubs, otherwise we are left with
unpaired stubs.
•  Randomly select a stub pair and connect them. Then randomly choose another pair from the
remaining 2L - 2 stubs and connect them. This procedure is repeated until all stubs are paired up.
Depending on the order in which the stubs were chosen, we obtain different networks. Some networks
include cycles (b), others self-loops (c) or multi-links (d). Yet, the expected number of self-loops and
multi-links goes to zero in the N → ∞ limit.

  

Configuration Model

The configuration model, described in Image 4.15, helps us build a network with a pre-defined
degree sequence. In the network generated by the model each node has a pre-defined degree ki,
but otherwise the network is wired randomly. Consequently the network is often called a random
network with a pre-deﬁned degree sequence. By repeatedly applying this procedure to the same
degree sequence we can generate different networks with the same pk (Image 4.15b-d). There are
a couple of caveats to consider:

=

kikj
2L−1

(4. 24)

•  The probability to have a link between nodes of degree ki and kj is
pij
Indeed, a stub starting from node i can connect to 2L - 1 other stubs. Of these, kj are attached to
node j. So the probability that a particular stub is connected to a stub of node j is kj /(2L - 1). As
node i has ki stubs, it has kj attempts to link to j, resulting in (4.24).
•  The obtained network contains self-loops and multi-links, as there is nothing in the
algorithm to forbid a node connecting to itself, or to generate multiple links between two nodes.
We can choose to reject stub pairs that lead to these, but if we do so, we may not be able to
complete the network. Rejecting self-loops or multi-links also means that not all possible
matchings appear with equal probability. Hence (4.24) will not be valid, making analytical
calculations difficult. Yet, the number of self-loops and multi-links remain negligible, as the
number of choices to connect to increases with N, so typically we do not need to exclude them
[42].
•  The configuration model is frequently used in calculations, as (4.24) and its inherently
random character helps us analytically calculate numerous network measures.

multiple ways we can pair up the stubs.

To generate a degree sequence from a pre-defined degree distribution we start from an
analytically pre-defined degree distribution, like pk~k-γ, shown in Image 4.16a. Our goal is
to generate a degree sequence {k1, k2, ..., kN} that follow the distribution pk. We start by
calculating the function

generate a sequence of N degrees following pk, we generate N random numbers ri, i = 1, ...,
N, chosen uniformly from the (0, 1) interval. For each ri we use the plot in (b) to assign a
degree ki. The obtained ki = D-1(ri) set of numbers follows the desired pk distribution. Note
that the degree sequence assigned to a pk is not unique - we can generate multiple sets of
{k1, ..., kN} sequences compatible with the same pk.

As we explore the properties of a real network, we often need to ask if a certain network

property is predicted by its degree distribution alone, or if it represents some additional
by Albert-László Barabási
property not contained in pk. To answer this question we need to generate networks that are
wired randomly, but whose pk is identical to the original network. This can be achieved through
degree-preserving randomization [43] described in Image 4.17b. The idea behind the algorithm is
simple: We randomly select two links and swap them, if the swap does not lead to multi-links.
Hence the degree of each of the four involved nodes in the swap remains unchanged.
Consequently, hubs stay hubs and small-degree nodes retain their small degree, but the wiring
diagram of the generated network is randomized. Note that degree-preserving randomization is
different from full randomization, where we swap links without preserving the node degrees
(Image 4.17a). Full randomization turns any network into an Erdős-Rényi network with a
Poisson degree distribution that is independent of the original pk.

Degree Preserving Randomization
Two algorithms can generate a randomized version of a given network [43], with different outcomes.
• Full Randomization
This algorithm generates a random (Erdős–Rényi) network with the same N and L as the original
network. We select randomly a source node (S1) and two target nodes, where the ﬁrst target (T1) is
linked directly to the source node and the second target (T2) is not. We rewire the S1-T1 link, turning it
into an S1-T2 link. As a result the degree of the target nodes T1 and T2 changes. We perform this
procedure once for each link in the network.

Bottom Panels: Starting from a scale-free network (middle), full randomization eliminates the hubs and

Hidden Parameter Model

The configuration model generates self-loops and multi-links, features that are absent in many
real networks. We can use the hidden parameter model (Image 4.18) to generate networks with a
pre-defined pk but without multi-links and self-loops [44, 45, 46].

We start from N isolated nodes and assign each node i a hidden parameter ηi, chosen from a
distribution ρ(η). The nature of the generated network depends on the selection of the {ηi}
hidden parameter sequence. There are two ways to generate the appropriate hidden parameters:

In summary, the configuration model, degree-preserving randomization and the hidden
parameter model can generate networks with a pre-defined degree distribution and help us
analytically calculate key network characteristics. We will turn to these algorithms each time we
explore whether a certain network property is a consequence of the network’s degree
distribution, or if it represents some emergent property (BOX 4.8). As we use these algorithms,
we must be aware of their limitations:

•  The algorithms do not tell us why a network has a certain degree distribution. Understanding
the origin of the observed pk will be the subject of CHAPTERS 6 and 7.
•  Several important network characteristics, from clustering (CHAPTER 9) to degree
correlations (CHAPTER 7), are lost during randomization.

Box 4.8

Testing the Small-Word Property

In the literature the distances observed in a real network are often compared to the
small-world formula (3.19). Yet, (3.19) was derived for random networks, while real
networks do not have a Poisson degree distribution. If the network is scale-free, then
(4.22) offers the appropriate formula. Yet, (4.22) provides only the scaling of the distance
with N, and not its absolute value. Instead of fitting the average distance, we often ask:
Are the distances observed in a real network comparable with the distances observed in a
randomized network with the same degree distribution? Degree preserving randomization
helps answer this question. We illustrate the procedure on the protein interaction
network.

•  Original Network
We start by measuring the distance distribution pd of theoriginal network, obtaining 〈d〉=
5.61 (Image 4.19).
•  Full Randomization
We generate a random network with the same N and L as the original network. The
obtained pd visibly shifts to the right, providing 〈d〉 = 7.13, much larger than the original
〈d〉 = 5.61. It is tempting to conclude that the protein interaction network is affected by
some unknown organizing principle that keeps the distances shorter. This would be a
flawed conclusion, however, as the bulk of the difference is due to the fact that full
randomization changed the degree distribution.

Hence, the networks generated by these algorithms are a bit like a photograph of a painting: at
first look they appear to be the same as the original. Upon closer inspection we realize, however,
that many details, from the texture of the canvas to the brush strokes, are lost.

The three algorithms discussed above raise the following question: How do we decide which one
to use? Our choice depends on whether we start from a degree sequence {ki} or a degree
distribution pk and whether we can tolerate self-loops and multi-links between two nodes. The
decision tree involved in this choice is provided in Image 4.20.

that the obtained networks are simple and have the degree sequence of the original network. The model

network.

If we wish to generate a network with given pre-deﬁned degree distribution pk, we have two options. If
pk is known, the conﬁguration model offers a convenient algorithm for network generation. For example,
the model allows us generate a networks with a pure power law degree distribution pk=Ck–γ for k≥ kmin.

However, tuning the average degree 〈k〉 of a scale-free network within the conﬁguration model is a
tedious task, because the only available free parameter is kmin. Therefore, if we wish to alter 〈k〉, it is
more convenient to use the hidden parameter model with parameter sequence (4.28). This way the tail
of the degree distribution follows ~k-γ and by changing the number of links L we can to control 〈k〉.

Section 4.9

Summary

The scale-free property has played an important role in the development of network science for
two main reasons:

•  Many networks of scientific and practical interest, from the WWW to the subcellular
networks, are scale-free. This universality made the scale-free property an unavoidable issue in
many disciplines.
•  Once the hubs are present, they fundamentally change the system’s behavior. The ultra-
small property offers a first hint of their impact on a network’s properties; we will encounter
many more examples in the coming chapters.

As we continue to explore the consequences of the scale-free property, we must keep in mind
that the power-law form (4.1) is rarely seen in this pure form in real systems. The reason is that
a host of processes affect the topology of each network, which also influence the shape of the
degree distribution. We will discuss these processes in the coming chapters. The diversity of
these processes and the complexity of the resulting pk confuses those who approach these
networks through the narrow perspective of the quality of fit to a pure power law. Instead the
scale-free property tells us that we must distinguish two rather different classes of networks:

Exponentially Bounded Networks

We call a network exponentially bounded if its degree distribution decrease exponentially or faster
for high k. As a consequence ‹k2› is smaller than ‹k›, implying that we lack significant degree

variations. Examples of pk in this class include the Poisson, Gaussian, or the simple exponential
Network Science
distribution (Table 4.2). Erdős-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz networks are the best known models
by Albert-László Barabási
network belonging to this class. Exponentially bounded networks lack outliers, consequently
most nodes have comparable degrees. Real networks in this class include highway networks and
the power grid.

  

Fat Tailed Networks

We call a network fat tailed if its degree distribution has a power law tail in the high-k region. As
a consequence ‹k2› is much larger than ‹k›, resulting in considerable degree variations. Scale-
free networks with a power-law degree distribution (4.1) offer the best known example of
networks belonging to this class. Outliers, or exceptionally high-degree nodes, are not only
allowed but are expected in these networks. Networks in this class include the WWW, the
Internet, protein interaction networks, and most social and online networks.

While it would be desirable to statistically validate the precise form of the degree distribution,
often it is sufficient to decide if a given network has an exponentially bounded or a fat tailed
degree distribution (see ADVANCED TOPICS 4.A). If the degree distribution is exponentially
bounded, the random network model offers a reasonable starting point to understand its
topology. If the degree distribution is fat tailed, a scale-free network offers a better
approximation. We will also see in the coming chapters that the key signature of the fat tailed
behavior is the magniture of 〈k2〉: If 〈k2〉 is large, systems behave like scale-free networks; if 〈k2〉
is small, being comparable to 〈k〉(〈t〉+1), systems are well approximated by random networks.

In summary, to understand the properties of real networks, it is often sufficient to remember
that in scale-free networks a few highly connected hubs coexist with a large number of small
nodes. The presence of these hubs plays an important role in the system’s behavior. In this
chapter we explored the basic characteristics of scale-free networks. We are left, therefore, with
an important question: Why are so many real networks scale-free? The next chapter provides
the answer.

Power Laws

Power laws have a convoluted history in natural and social sciences, being interchangeably (and
occasionally incorrectly) called fat-tailed, heavytailed, long-tailed, Pareto, or Bradford distributions.
They also have a series of close relatives, like log-normal, Weibull, or Lévy distributions. In this
section we discuss some of the most frequently encountered distributions in network science
and their relationship to power laws.

Exponentially Bounded Distributions

Many quantities in nature, from the height of humans to the probability of being in a car
accident, follow bounded distributions. A common property of these is that px decays either
exponentially (e-x), or faster than exponentially (e-x2/σ2) for high x. Consequently the largest
expected x is bounded by some upper value xmax that is not too different from 〈x〉. Indeed, the
expected largest x obtained after we draw N numbers from a bounded px grows as xmax ~ logN or
slower. This means that outliers, representing unusually high x-values, are rare. They are so
rare that they are effectively forbidden, meaning that they do not occur with any meaningful
probability. Instead, most events drawn from a bounded distribution are in the vicinity of 〈x〉.

The high-x regime is called the tail of a distribution. Given the absence of numerous events in the
tail, these distributions are also called thin tailed.

Analytically the simplest bounded distribution is the exponential distribution e-λx. Within
network science the most frequently encountered bounded distribution is the Poisson
distribution (or its parent, the binomial distribution), which describes the degree distribution of

Fat Tailed Distributions

The terms fat tailed, heavy tailed, or long tailed refer to px whose decay at large x is slower than
exponential. In these distributions we often encounter events characterized by very large x
values, usually called outliers or rare events. The power-law distribution (4.1) represents the best
known example of a fat tailed distribution. An instantly recognizable feature of an fat tailed
distribution is that the magnitude of the events x drawn from it can span several orders of
magnitude. Indeed, in these distributions the size of the largest event after N trials scales as
xmax ~ Nζ where ζ is determined by the exponent γ characterizing the tail of the px distribution.
As Nζ grows fast, rare events or outliers occur with a noticeable frequency, often dominating the
properties of the system.

The relevance of fat tailed distributions to networks is provided by several factors:

•  Many quantities occurring in network science, like degrees, link weights and betweenness
centrality, follow a power-law distribution in both real and model networks.
•  The power-law form is analytically predicted by appropriate network models (CHAPTER 5).

Crossover Distribution (Log-Normal, Stretched Exponential)

When an empirically observed distribution appears to be between a power law and exponential,
crossover distributions are often used to fit the data. These distributions may be exponentially
bounded (power law with exponential cutoff), or not bounded but decay faster than a power law
(log-normal or stretched exponential). Next we discuss the properties of several frequently
encountered crossover distributions.

Power law with exponential cut-off is often used to fit the degree distribution of real networks. Its
density function has the form:

form (4.30) directly captures its crossover nature: it combines a power-law term, a key
component of fat tailed distributions, with an exponential term, responsible for its
exponentially bounded tail. To highlight its crossover characteristics we take the logarithm of

ln p(x) = ln C − γ ln x − λx
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási

For x ≪ 1/λ the second term on the r.h.s dominates, suggesting that the distribution follows a
power law with exponent γ. Once x ≫ 1/λ, the λx term overcomes the ln x term, resulting in an

exponential cutoff for high x.

Stretched exponential (Weibull distribution) is formally similar to (4.30) except that there is a
fractional power law in the exponential. Its name comes from the fact that its cumulative
distribution function is one minus a stretched exponential function P(x) = e-(λx)β (4.32) which
leads to density function

xβ−1e−(λx)β

(4. 33)

(x) = C
λβ

P′
C = β
In most applications x varies between 0 and +∞. In (4.32) β is the stretching exponent, determining
the properties of p(x):

(4. 34)

•  For β = 1 we recover a simple exponential function.
•  If β is between 0 and 1, the graph of log p(x) versus x is “stretched”, meaning that it spans
several orders of magnitude in x. This is the regime where a stretched exponential is difficult to
distinguish from a pure power law. The closer β is to 0, the more similar is p(x) to the power law
x-1.
•  If β > 1 we have a “compressed” exponential function, meaning that x varies in a very narrow
range.
•  For β = 2 (4.33) reduces to the Rayleigh distribution.

As we will see in CHAPTERS 5 and 6, several network models predict a streched exponential
degree distribution.

A log-normal distribution (Galton or Gibrat distribution) emerges if ln x follows a normal
distribution. Typically a variable follows a log-normal distribution if it is the product of many
independent positive random numbers. We encounter log-normal distributions in finance,
representing the compound return from a sequence of trades.

The probability density function of a log-normal distribution is

p(x) =

(4. 35)

Hence a log-normal is like a normal distribution except that its variable in the exponential term
is not x, but ln x.

To understand why a log-normal is occasionally used to fit a power law distribution, we note
that

captures the typical variation of the order of magnitude of x. Therefore now ln x follows a normal
distribution, which means that x can vary rather widely. Depending on the value of σ the log-
normal distribution may resemble a power law for several orders of magnitude. This is also
illustrated in Table 4.2, that shows that 〈x2〉 grows exponentially with σ, hence it can be very
large.

In summary, in most areas where we encounter fat-tailed distributions, there is an ongoing
debate asking which distribution offers the best fit to the data. Frequently encountered
candidates include a power law, a stretched exponential, or a log-normal function. In many
systems empirical data is not sufficient to distinguish these distributions. Hence as long as
there is empirical data to be fitted, the debate surrounding the best fit will never die out. The
debate is resolved by accurate mechanistic models, which analytically predict the expected
degree distribution.We will see in the coming chapters that in the context of networks the
models predict Poisson, simple exponential, stretched exponential, and power law distributions.
The remaining distributions in Table 4.2 are occasionally used to fit the degrees of some
networks, despite the fact that we lack theoretical basis for their relevance for networks.

Plotting Power-laws

Plotting the degree distribution is an integral part of analyzing the properties of a network. The
process starts with obtaining Nk, the number of nodes with degree k. This can be provided by
direct measurement or by a model. From Nk we calculate pk = Nk /N. The question is, how to plot
pk to best extract its properties.

Use a Log-Log Plot
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
In a scale-free network numerous nodes with one or two links coexist with a few hubs,
representing nodes with thousands or even millions of links. Using a linear k-axis compresses
the numerous small degree nodes in the small-k region, rendering them invisible. Similarly, as
there can be orders of magnitude differences in pk for k = 1 and for large k, if we plot pk on a
linear vertical axis, its value for large k will appear to be zero (Image 4.22a). The use of a log-log
plot avoids these problems. We can either use logarithmic axes, with powers of 10 (used
throughout this book, Image 4.22b) or we can plot log pk in function of log k (equally correct, but
slightly harder to read). Note that points with pk =0 or k=0 are not shown on a log-log plot as log
0=-∞.

Avoid Linear Binning

The most flawed method (yet frequently seen in the literature) is to simply plot pk = Nk/N on a
log-log plot (Image 4.22b). This is called linear binning, as each bin has the same size Δk = 1. For a
scale-free network linear binning results in an instantly recognizable plateau at large k,
consisting of numerous data points that form a horizontal line (Image 4.22b). This plateau has a
simple explanation: Typically we have only one copy of each high degree node, hence in the
high-k region we either have Nk=0 (no node with degree k) or Nk=1 (a single node with degree k).
Consequently linear binning will either provide pk=0, not shown on a log-log plot, or pk = 1/N,
which applies to all hubs, generating a plateau at pk = 1/N.

This plateau affects our ability to estimate the degree exponent γ. For example, if we attempt to
fit a power law to the data shown in Image 4.22b using linear binning, the obtained γ is quite
different from the real value γ=2.5. The reason is that under linear binning we have a large
number of nodes in small k bins, allowing us to confidently fit pk in this regime. In the large-k
bins we have too few nodes for a proper statistical estimate of pk. Instead the emerging plateau
biases our fit. Yet, it is precisely this high-k regime that plays a key role in determining γ.
Increasing the bin size will not solve this problem. It is therefore recommended to avoid linear
binning for fat tailed distributions.

Use Logarithmic Binning

Logarithmic binning corrects the non-uniform sampling of linear binning. For log-binning we
let the bin sizes increase with the degree, making sure that each bin has a comparable number
of nodes. For example, we can choose the bin sizes to be multiples of 2, so that the first bin has
size b0=1, containing all nodes with k=1; the second has size b1=2, containing nodes with degrees
k=2, 3; the third bin has size b2=4 containing nodes with degrees k=4, 5, 6, 7. By induction the nth
bin has size 2n-1 and contains all nodes with degrees k=2n-1, 2n-1+1, ..., 2n-1-1. Note that the bin
size can increase with arbitrary increments, bn = cn, where c > 1. The degree distribution is given
by p〈kn〉=Nn/bn, where Nn is the number of nodes found in the bin n of size bn and 〈kn〉 is the
average degree of the nodes in bin bn.

The logarithmically binned pk is shown in Image 4.22c. Note that now the scaling extends into
the high-k plateau, invisible under linear binning. Therefore logarithmic binning extracts useful
information from the rare high degree nodes as well (BOX 4.10).

Use Cumulative Distribution

Another way to extract information from the tail of pk is to plot the complementary cumulative
distribution

=pk

∞
∑
q=k+1

pq

which again enhances the statistical significance the high-degree region. If pk follows the power
law (4.1), then the cumulative distribution scales as

k−γ+1

∼pk
The cumulative distribution again eliminates the plateau observed for linear binning and leads
to an extended scaling region (Image 4.22d), allowing for a more accurate estimate of the degree
exponent.

In summary, plotting the degree distribution to extract its features requires special attention.
Mastering the appropriate tools can help us better explore the properties of real networks (BOX
4.10).

Box 4.10

Degree Distribution of Real Networks

  

In real systems we rarely observe a degree distribution that follows a pure power law.
Instead, for most real systems pk has the shape shown in Image 4.23a, with some
recurring features:

•  Low-degree saturation is a common deviation from the power-law behavior. Its
signature is a flattened pk for k < ksat. This indicates that we have fewer small degree
nodes than expected for a pure power law. The origin of the saturation will be explained in
CHAPTER 6.
•  High-degree cutoff appears as a rapid drop in pk for k > kcut, indicating that we have fewer
high-degree nodes than expected in a pure power law. This limits the size of the largest
hub, making it smaller than predicted by (4.18). High-degree cutoffs emerge if there are
inherent limitations in the number of links a node can have. For example, in social
networks individuals have difficulty maintaining meaningful relationships with an
exceptionally large number of acquaintances.

Given the widespread presence of such cutoffs the degree distribution is occasionally
fitted to

px

ksat)−γ

exp(− )

k
kcut

(4. 39)

where ksat accounts for degree saturation, and the exponential term accounts for high-k
cutoff. To extract the full extent of the scaling we plot

p̃ x
in function of k̃ = k + ksat. According to (4.40) p̃ ~ k̃ -γ, correcting for the two cutoffs, as
seen in Image 4.23b.

(4. 40)

It is occasionally claimed that the presence of low-degree or high-degree cutoffs implies
that the network is not scale-free. This is a misunderstanding of the scale-free property:
Virtually all properties of scale-free networks are insensitive to the low-degree
saturation. Only the high-degree cutoff affects the system’s properties by limiting the
divergence of the second moment,〈k2〉. The presence of such cutoffs indicates the
presence of additional phenomena that need to be understood.

Rescaling the Degree Distribution
•  In real networks the degree distribution frequently deviates from a pure power law by showing
a low degree saturation and high degree cutoff.
•  By plotting the rescaled p̃ kin function of (k + ksat), as suggested by (4.40), the degree
distribution follows a power law for all degrees.

Section 4.13

Advanced Topic 3.C
Estimating the Degree Exponent

As the properties of scale-free networks depend on the degree exponent (SECTION 4.7), we need
to determine the value of γ. We face several difficulties, however, when we try to fit a power law
to real data. The most important is the fact that the scaling is rarely valid for the full range of
the degree distribution. Rather we observe small- and high- degree cutoffs (BOX 4.10), denoted
in this section with Kmin and Kmax, within which we have a clear scaling region. Note that Kmin
and Kmax are different from Kmin and Kmax, the latter corresponding to the smallest and largest
degrees in a network. They can be the same as ksat and kcut discussed in BOX 4.10. Here we focus
on estimating the small degree cutoff Kmin, as the high degree cutoff can be determined in a
similar fashion. The reader is advised to consult the discussion on systematic problems provided
at the end of this section before implementing this procedure.

Fitting Procedure

As the degree distribution is typically provided as a list of positive integers kmin , ..., kmax, we
aim to estimate γ from a discrete set of data points [47]. We use the citation network to
illustrate the procedure. The network consists of N=384,362 nodes, each node representing a
research paper published between 1890 and 2009 in journals published by the American Physical
Society. The network has L = 2,353,984 links, each representing a citation from a published
research paper to some other publication in the dataset (outside citations are ignored). For no
particular reason, this is not the citation dataset listed in Table 4.1. See [48] for an overall
characterization of this data. The steps of the fitting process are [47]:

•  Choose a value of Kmin between kmin and kmax. Estimate the value of the degree exponent
corresponding to this Kmin using

Kmin value for which D provided by (4.44) is minimal. To illustrate the procedure, we plot D as a
function of Kmin for the citation network (Image 4.24b). The plot indicates that D is minimal for
Kmin= 49, and the corresponding γ estimated by (4.41), representing the optimal fit, is γ=2.79.

Goodness-of-fit

Just because we obtained a (γ, Kmin) pair that represents an optimal fit to our dataset, does not
mean that the power law itself is a good model for the studied distribution.We therefore need to
use a goodness-of-fit test, which generates a p-value that quantifies the plausibility of the
power law hypothesis. The most often used procedure consists of the following steps:

•  Use the cumulative distribution (4.43) to estimate the KS distance between the real data and
the best fit, that we denote by Dreal. This is step 3 above, taking the value of D for Kmin that
offered the best fit to the data. For the citation data we obtain Dreal = 0.01158 for Kmin=49 (Image
4.24c).
•  Use (4.42) to generate a degree sequence of N degrees (i.e. the same number of random
numbers as the number of nodes in the original dataset) and substitute the obtained degree
sequence for the empirical data, determining Dsynthetic for this hypothetical degree sequence.
Hence Dsynthetic represents the distance between a synthetically generated degree sequence,
consistent with our degree distribution, and the real data.
•  The goal is to see if the obtained Dsynthetic is comparable to Dreal. For this we repeat step (2) M

that the distance between the model providing the best fit and the empirical data is comparable
with the distance expected from random degree samples chosen from the best fit distribution.
Hence the power law is a reasonable model for the data. If, however, Dreal falls outside the
p(Dsynthetic) distribution, then the power law is not a good model - some other function is
expected to describe the original pk better.

While the distribution shown in Image 4.24c may be in some cases useful to illustrate the
statistical significance of the fit, in general it is better to assign a p-number to the fit, given by

p = P(

The closer p is to 1, the more likely that the difference between the empirical data and the model
can be attributed to statistical fluctuations alone. If p is very small, the model is not a plausible
fit to the data.

Typically, the model is accepted if p > 1%. For the citation network we obtain p < 10-4, indicating
that a pure power law is not a suitable model for the original degree distribution. This outcome
is somewhat surprising, as the power-law nature of citation data has been documented
repeatedly since 1960s [7, 8]. This failure indicates the limitation of the blind fitting to a power
law, without an analytical understanding of the underlying distribution.

Fitting Real Distributions

To correct the problem, we note that the fitting model (4.44) eliminates all the data points with
k < Kmin. As the citation network is fat tailed, choosing Kmin = 49 forces us to discard over 96% of
the data points. Yet, there is statistically useful information in the k < Kmin regime, that is
ignored by the previous fit. We must introduce an alternate model that resolves this problem.

As we discussed in BOX 4.10, the degree distribution of many real networks, like the citation
network, does not follow a pure power law. It often has low degree saturations and high degree
cutoffs, described by the form

where ksat and kcut correspond to low-k saturation and the large-k cutoff, respectively. The
difference between our earlier procedure and (4.47) is that we now do not discard the points that
deviate from a pure power law, but instead use a function that offers a better fit to the whole
degree distribution, from kmin to kmax.

Our goal is to find the fitting parameters ksat, kcut, and γ of the model (4.47), which we achieve
through the following steps (Image 4.25):

•  Pick a value for ksat and kcut between Kmin and Kmax. Estimate the value of the degree exponent
γ using the steepest descend method that maximizes the log-likelihood function

That is, for fixed (ksat, kcut) we vary γ until we find the maximum of (4.49).
•  With the obtained γ(ksat, kcut) assume that the degree distribution has the form (4.47).
Calculate the Kormogorov Smirnov parameter D between the cumulative degree distribution
(CDF) of the original data and the fitted model provided by (4.47).
•  Change ksat and kcut, and repeat steps (1-3), scanning with ksat from kmin= 0 to kmax and
scanning with kcut from kmin= k0 to kmax. The goal is to identify ksat and kcut values for which D is
minimal. We illustrate this by plotting D in function of ksat for several kcut values in Image 4.25a
for our citation network. The (ksat, kcut) for which D is minimal, and the corresponding γ is
provided by (4.41), represent the optimal parameters of the fit. For our dataset the optimal fit is
obtained for /ksat= 12 and kcut= 5,691, providing the degree exponent γ= 3.028. We find that now D
for the real data is within the generated p(D) distribution (Image 4.25c), and the associated
p-value is 69%.

Systematic Fitting Issues

The procedure described above may offer the impression that determining the degree exponent
is a cumbersome but straightforward process. In reality these fitting methods have some well
known limitations:

•  A pure power law is an idealized distribution that emerges in its form (4.1) only in simple
models (CHAPTER 5). In reality, a whole range of processes contribute to the topology of real
networks, affecting the precise shape of the degree distribution. These processes will be
discussed in CHAPTER 6. If pk does not follow a pure power law, the methods described above,
designed to fit a power law to the data, will inevitably fail to detect statistical significance. While
this finding can mean that the network is not scale-free, it most often means that we have not
yet gained a proper understanding of the precise form of the degree distribution. Hence we are
fitting the wrong functional form of pk to the dataset.
•  The statistical tools used above to test the goodness-of-fit rely on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
criteria, which measures the maximum distance between the fitted model and the dataset. If
almost all data points follow a perfect power law, but a single point for some reason deviates
from the curve, we will loose the fit’s statistical significance. In real systems there are
numerous reasons for such local deviations that have little impact on the system’s overall
behavior. Yet, removing these “outliers” could be seen as data manipulation; if kept, however,
one cannot detect the statistical significance of the power law fit.
•  A good example is provided by the actor network, whose degree distribution follows a power
law for most degrees. There is, however, a prominent outlier at k = 1,287, thanks to the 1956
movie Around the World in Eighty Days. This is the only movie where imdb.com the source of the
actor network, lists all the normally uncredited extras in the cast. Hence the movie appears to
have 1,288 actors. The second largest movie in the dataset has only 340 actors. Since each extra
has links only to the 1,287 extras that played in the same movie, we have a local peak in pk at
k=1,287. Thanks to this peak, the degree distribution, fitted to a power law, fails to pass the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov criteria. Indeed, as indicated in Table 4.3, neither the pure power law fit,
nor a power law with high-degree cutoff offers a statistically significant fit. Yet, ultimately this
single point does not alter the power law nature of the degreee distribution.

Table 4.3
Degree Fluctuations in Real Networks For the power grid a power law degree distribution does
not offer a statistically significant fit. Indeed, we will encounter numerous evidence that the
underlying network is not scale-free. We used the fitting procedure described in this section to
fit the exponential function e-λk to the degree distribution of the power grid, obtaining a
statistically significant fit. The table shows the obtained λ parameters, the kmin over which the
fit is valid, the obtained p-value, and the percentage of data points included in the fit.
In summary, estimating the degree exponent is still not yet an exact science. We continue to
lack methods that would estimate the statistical significance in a manner that would be
acceptable to a practitioner. The blind application of the tools describe above often leads to
either fits that obviously do not capture the trends in the data, or to a false rejection of the
power-law hypothesis. An important improvement is our ability to derive the expected form of
the degree distribution, a problem discussed in CHAPTER 6.

Section 5.1

Introduction

Hubs represent the most striking difference between a random and a scale-free network. On the
World Wide Web, they are websites with an exceptional number of links, like google.com or
facebook.com; in the metabolic network they are molecules like ATP or ADP, energy carriers
involved in an exceptional number of chemical reactions. The very existence of these hubs and
the related scale-free topology raises two fundamental questions:

•  Why do so different systems as the WWW or the cell converge to a similar scale-free
architecture?
•  Why does the random network model of Erdős and Rényi fail to reproduce the hubs and the
power laws observed in real networks?

The first question is particularly puzzling given the fundamental differences in the nature,
origin, and scope of the systems that display the scale-free property:

•  The nodes of the cellular network are metabolites or proteins, while the nodes of the WWW
are documents, representing information without a physical manifestation.
•  The links within the cell are chemical reactions and binding interactions, while the links of the
WWW are URLs, or small segments of computer code.
•  The history of these two systems could not be more different: The cellular network is shaped
by 4 billion years of evolution, while the WWW is less than three decades old.
•  The purpose of the metabolic network is to produce the chemical components the cell needs to
stay alive, while the purpose of the WWW is information access and delivery.

To understand why so different systems converge to a similar architecture we need to first
understand the mechanism responsible for the emergence of the scale-free property. This is the
main topic of this chapter. Given the diversity of the systems that display the scale-free
property, the explanation must be simple and fundamental. The answers will change the way we
model networks, forcing us to move from describing a network’s topology to modeling the
evolution of a complex system.

Networks Expand Through the Addition of New Nodes

  

The random network model assumes that we have a ﬁxed number of nodes, N. Yet, in real
networks the number of nodes continually grows thanks to the addition of new nodes.

Consider a few examples:

•  In 1991 the WWW had a single node, the first webpage build by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator
of the Web. Today the Web has over a trillion (1012) documents, an extraordinary number that
was reached through the continuous addition of new documents by millions of individuals and
institutions (Image 5.1a).
•  The collaboration and the citation network continually expands through the publication of
new research papers (Image 5.1b).
•  The actor network continues to expand through the release of new movies (Image 5.1c).
•  The protein interaction network may appear to be static, as we inherit our genes (and hence
our proteins) from our parents. Yet, it is not: The number of genes grew from a few to the over
20,000 genes present in a human cell over four billion years.

Consequently, if we wish to model these networks, we cannot resort to a static model. Our
modeling approach must instead acknowledge that networks are the product of a steady growth
process.

The Growth of Networks
Networks are not static, but grow via the addition of new nodes:
•  The evolution of the number of WWW hosts, documenting the Web’s rapid growth. After
http://www.isc.org/solutions/ survey/history.
•  The number of scientiﬁc papers published in Physical Review since the journal’s founding. The
increasing number of papers drives the growth of both the science collaboration network as well as of
the citation network shown in the ﬁgure.
•  Number of movies listed in IMDB.com, driving the growth of the actor network.

Nodes Prefer to Link to the More Connected Nodes

The random network model assumes that we randomly choose the interaction partners of a
node. Yet, most real networks new nodes prefer to link to the more connected nodes, a process called
preferential attachment (Image 5.2).

Consider a few examples:

•  We are familiar with only a tiny fraction of the trillion or more documents available on the
WWW. The nodes we know are not entirely random: We all heard about Google and Facebook,
but we rarely encounter the billions of less-prominent nodes that populate the Web. As our
knowledge is biased towards the more popular Web documents, we are more likely to link to a
high-degree node than to a node with only few links.
•  No scientist can attempt to read the more than a million scientific papers published each
year. Yet, the more cited is a paper, the more likely that we hear about it and eventually read it.
As we cite what we read, our citations are biased towards the more cited publications,
representing the high-degree nodes of the citation network.
•  The more movies an actor has played in, the more familiar is a casting director with her skills.
Hence, the higher the degree of an actor in the actor network, the higher are the chances that

In summary, the random network model differs from real networks in two important
characteristics:

  

•  Growth
Real networks are the result of a growth process that continuously increases N. In contrast the
random network model assumes that the number of nodes, N, is fixed.
•  Preferential Attachment
In real networks new nodes tend to link to the more connected nodes. In contrast nodes in
random networks randomly choose their interaction partners.

There are many other differences between real and random networks, some of which will be
discussed in the coming chapters. Yet, as we show next, these two, growth and preferential
attachment, play a particularly important role in shaping a network’s degree distribution.

The Barabási-Albert Model
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
The recognition that growth and preferential attachment coexist in real networks has inspired a
minimal model called the Barabási-Albert model, which can generate scale-free networks [1].
Also known as the BA model or the scale-free model, it is defined as follows:

  

We start with m0 nodes, the links between which are chosen arbitrarily, as long as each node has
at least one link. The network develops following two steps (Image 5.3):

•  Growth
At each timestep we add a new node with m (≤ m0) links that connect the new node to m nodes
already in the network. Preferential attachment
The probability Π(k) that a link of the new node connects to node i depends on the degree ki as
Π(
ki

(5. 1)

) =

ki
∑
kj
j

Preferential attachment is a probabilistic mechanism: A new node is free to connect to any node
in the network, whether it is a hub or has a single link. Equation (5.1) implies, however, that if a
new node has a choice between a degree-two and a degree-four node, it is twice as likely that it
connects to the degree-four node.

Image 5.3
Evolution of the Barabási-Albert Model
The sequence of images shows nine subsequent steps of the Barabási-Albert model. Empty circles mark
the newly added node to the network, which decides where to connect its two links (m=2) using
preferential attachment (5.1). After [9].

After t timesteps the Barabási-Albert model generates a network with N = t + m0 nodes and m0 +
mt links. As Image 5.4 shows, the obtained network has a power-law degree distribution with

As Image 5.3 and Video 5.2 indicate, while most nodes in the network have only a few links, a
few gradually turn into hubs. These hubs are the result of a rich-gets-richer phenomenon: Due to
preferential attachment new nodes are more likely to connect to the more connected nodes than
to the smaller nodes. Hence, the larger nodes will acquire links at the expense of the smaller
nodes, eventually becoming hubs.

In summary, the Barabási-Albert model indicates that two simple mechanisms, growth and
preferential attachment, are responsible for the emergence of scale-free networks. The origin of
the power law and the associated hubs is a rich-gets-richer phenomenon induced by the
coexistence of these two ingredients. To understand the model’s behavior and to quantify the
emergence of the scale-free property, we need to become familiar with the model’s
mathematical properties, which is the subject of the next section.

The Linearized Chord Diagram (LCD)
The construction of the LCD, the version of the Barabási-Albert model amenable to exact
mathematical calculations [10]. The ﬁgure shows the ﬁrst four steps of the network's evolution
for m=1

G1

(0): We start with an empty network.

(1): The ﬁrst node can only link to itself, forming a self-loop. Self-loops are allowed, and so are

G1
multi-links for m>1.

(2): Node 2 can either connect to node 1 with probability 2/3, or to itself with probability 1/3.

G1
According to (5.2), half of the links that the new node 2 brings along is already counted as
present. Consequently node 1 has degree k1=2 at node 2 has degree k2=1, the normalization
constant being 3.

(3): Let us assume that the ﬁrst of the two G1

(t) network possibilities have materialized. When
G1
node 3 comes along, it again has three choices: It can connect to node 2 with probability 1/5, to
node 1 with probability 3/5 and to itself with probability 1/5.

The definition of the Barabási-Albert model leaves many mathematical details open:

•  It does not specify the precise initial configuration of the first m0 nodes.
•  It does not specify whether the m links assigned to a new node are added one by one, or
simultaneously. This leads to potential mathematical conflicts: If the links are truly
independent, they could connect to the same node i, resulting in multi-links.

Bollobás and collaborators [10] proposed the Linearized Chord Diagram (LCD) to resolve
these problems, making the model more amenable to mathematical approaches.

According to the LCD, for m=1 we build a graph G1

(t) as follows (Image 5.5):

Degree Dynamics

To understand the emergence of the scale-free property, we need to focus on the time evolution
of the Barabási-Albert model. We begin by exploring the time-dependent degree of a single
node [11].

In the model an existing node can increase its degree each time a new node enters the network.
This new node will link to m of the N(t) nodes already present in the system. The probability that
one of these links connects to node i is given by (5.1).

Let us approximate the degree ki with a continuous real variable, representing its expectation
value over many realizations of the growth process. The rate at which an existing node i acquires
links as a result of new nodes connecting to it is

except the newly added node, thus

of the Barabási-Albert model: Each new node has more nodes to link to than the previous node.
Hence, with time the existing nodes compete for links with an increasing pool of other nodes.
•  The earlier node i was added, the higher is its degree ki(t). Hence, hubs are large because they

Time in Networks

As we compare the predictions of the network models with real data, we have to decide
how to measure time in networks. Real networks evolve over rather different time scales:

World Wide Web
The first webpage was created in 1991. Given its trillion documents, the WWW added a
node each millisecond (103 sec).

Cell
The cell is the result of 4 billion years of evolution. With roughly 20,000 genes in a human
cell, on average the cellular network added a node every 200,000 years (~1013 sec).

Given these enormous time-scale differences it is impossible to use real time to compare
the dynamics of different networks. Therefore, in network theory we use event time,
advancing our time-step by one each time when there is a change in the network
topology.

For example, in the Barabási-Albert model the addition of each new node corresponds to
a new time step, hence t=N. In other models time is also advanced by the arrival of a new
link or the deletion of a node. If needed, we can establish a direct mapping between event
time and the physical time.

Section 5.5

Degree Distribution

The distinguishing feature of the networks generated by the Barabási- Albert model is their
power-law degree distribution (Image 5.4). In this section we calculate the functional form of pk,
helping us understand its origin.

A number of analytical tools are available to calculate the degree distribution of the Barabási-
Albert network. The simplest is the continuum theory that we started developing in the previous
section [1, 11]. It predicts the degree distribution (BOX 5.3),

Therefore the degree distribution follows a power law with degree exponent γ=3, in agreement
with the numerical results (Figures 5.4 and 5.7). Moreover (5.10) links the degree exponent, γ, a
quantity characterizing the network topology, to the dynamical exponent β that characterizes a
node’s temporal evolution, revealing a deep relationship between the network's topology and
dynamics.

Image 5.7
Probing the Analytical Predictions
•  We generated networks with N=100,000 and m0=m=1 (blue), 3 (green), 5 (grey), and 7 (orange). The
fact that the curves are parallel to each other indicates that γ is independent of m and m0. The slope of
the purple line is -3, corresponding to the predicted degree exponent γ=3. Inset: (5.11) predicts pk~2m2,
hence pk/2m2 should be independent of m. Indeed, by plotting pk/2m2 vs. k, the data points shown in
the main plot collapse into a single curve.
•  The Barabási-Albert model predicts that pk is independent of N. To test this we plot pk for N = 50,000
(blue), 100,000 (green), and 200,000 (grey), with m0=m=3. The obtained pk are practically
indistinguishable, indicating that the degree distribution is stationary, i.e. independent of time and
system size.

While the continuum theory predicts the correct degree exponent, it fails to accurately predict
the pre-factors of (5.9). The correct pre-factors can be obtained using a master [12] or rate
equation [13] approach or calculated exactly using the LCD model [10] (BOX 5.3). Consequently
the exact degree distribution of the Barabási-Albert model is (ADVANCED TOPICS 5.A)

•  For large k (5.11) reduces to pk~ k-3, or γ = 3, in line with (5.9) and (5.10).
•  The degree exponent γ is independent of m, a prediction that agrees with the numerical
results (Image 5.7a).
•  The power-law degree distribution observed in real networks describes systems of rather
different age and size. Hence, an approriate model should lead to a time-independent degree
distribution. Indeed, according to (5.11) the degree distribution of the Barabási-Albert model is
independent of both t and N. Hence the model predicts the emergence of a stationary scale-free
state. Numerical simulations support this prediction, indicating that pk observed for different t
(or N) fully overlap (Image 5.7b).
•  Equation (5.11) predicts that the coefficient of the power-law distribution is proportional to
m(m + 1) (or m2 for large m), again confirmed by numerical simulations (Image 5.7a, inset).

In summary, the analytical calculations predict that the Barabási-Albert model generates a
scale-free network with degree exponent γ=3. The degree exponent is independent of the m and
m0 parameters. Furthermore, the degree distribution is stationary (i.e. time invariant),
explaining why networks with different history, size and age develop a similar degree
distribution.

The Absence of Growth or Preferential Attachment

The coexistence of growth and preferential attachment in the Barabási- Albert model raises an
important question: Are they both necessary for the emergence of the scale-free property? In
other words, could we generate a scale-free network with only one of the two ingredients? To
address these questions, next we discuss two limiting cases of the model, each containing only
one of the two ingredients [1, 11].

Section 5.6

Model A

To test the role of preferential attachment we keep the growing character of the network
(ingredient A) and eliminate preferential attachment (ingredient B). Hence, Model A starts with
m0 nodes and evolves following these steps:

•  Growth
At each time step we add a new node with m(≤m0) links that connect to m nodes added earlier.
•  Preferential Attachment
The probability that a new node links to a node with degree ki is
Π(
ki

(5. 16)

) =

That is, Π(ki) is independent of ki, indicating that new nodes choose randomly the nodes they
link to.

  
Therefore the lack of preferential attachment eliminates the network’s scale-free character and
by Albert-László Barabási
the hubs. Indeed, as all nodes acquire links with equal probabilty, we lack a rich-get-richer
process and no clear winner can emerge.

Model B

To test the role of growth next we keep preferential attachment (ingredient B) and eliminate
growth (ingredient A). Hence, Model B starts with N nodes and evolves following this step:

•  Preferential Attachment
At each time step a node is selected randomly and connected to node i with degree ki already
present in the network, where i is chosen with probability Π(k). As Π(0)=0 nodes with k=0 are
assumed to have k=1, otherwise they can not acquire links.

In Model B the number of nodes remains constant during the network’s evolution, while the
number of links increases linearly with time. As a result for large t the degree of each node also
increases linearly with time (Image 5.7b, inset)

(5. 19)

2
(t) ≈ t
ki
N
Indeed, in each time step we add a new link, without changing the number of nodes.

At early times, when there are only a few links in the network (i.e. L ≪ N), each new link

connects previously unconnected nodes. In this stage the model’s evolution is indistinguishable
from the Barabási-Albert model with m=1. Numerical simulations show that in this regime the
model develops a degree distribution with a power-law tail (Image 5.8b).

Yet, pk is not stationary. Indeed, after a transient period the node degrees converge to the
average degree (5.19) and the degree develops a peak (Image 5.8b). For t → N(N-1)/2 the network
becomes a complete graph in which all nodes have degree kmax=N-1, hence pk= δ(N-1).

In summary, the absence of preferential attachment leads to a growing network with a
stationary but exponential degree distribution. In contrast the absence of growth leads to the
loss of stationarity, forcing the network to converge to a complete graph. This failure of Models
A and B to reproduce the empirically observed scale-free distribution indicates that growth and
preferential attachment are simultaneously needed for the emergence of the scale-free
property.

In the previous section we showed that growth and preferential attachment are jointly

large networks have reached their current size by adding new nodes. But to convince ourselves
that preferential attachment is also present in real networks, we need to detect it
experimentally. In this section we show how to detect preferential attachment by measuring the
Π(k) function in real networks.

  

Preferential attachment relies on two distinct hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1
The likelihood to connect to a node depends on that node’s degree k. This is in contrast with the
random network model, for which Π(k) is independent of k.

Hypothesis 2
The functional form of Π(k) is linear in k.

Both hypotheses can be tested by measuring Π(k). We can determine Π(k) for systems for which
we know the time at which each node joined the network, or we have at least two network maps
collected at not too distant moments in time [14, 15].

Consider a network for which we have two different maps, the first taken at time t and the
second at time t + Δt (Image 5.9a). For nodes that changed their degree during the Δt time frame
we measure Δki = ki(t+Δt )−ki(t). According to (5.1), the relative change Δki/Δt should follow

Detecting Preferential Attachment
•  If we have access to two maps of the same network taken at time t and t+Δt, comparing them allows
us to measure the Π(k) function. Speciﬁcally, we look at nodes that have gained new links thanks to the
arrival of the two new green nodes at t+Δt. The orange lines correspond to links that connect previously
disconnected nodes, called internal links. Their role is discussed in CHAPTER 6.

attachment.

In summary, (5.20) allows us to detect the presence (or absence) of preferential attachment in
real networks. The measurements show that the attachment probability depends on the node
degree. We also find that while in some systems preferential attachment is linear, in others it
can be sublinear. The implications of this non-linearity are discussed in the next section.

Non-linear Preferential Attachment

The observation of sublinear preferential attachment in Image 5.10 raises an important
question: What is the impact of this nonlinearity on the network topology? To answer this we
replace the linear preferential attachment (5.1) with (5.22) and calculate the degree distribution
of the obtained nonlinear Barabási-Albert model.

The behavior for α=0 is clear: In the absence of preferential attachment we are back to Model A
discussed in SECTION 5.4. Consequently the degree distribution follows the exponential (5.17).

The Growth of the Hubs
The nature of preferential attachment affects the degree of the largest node. While in a scalefree
network (α=1) the biggest hub grows as t1/2 (green curve, (4.18)), for sublinear preferential attachment
(α < 1) this dependence becomes logarithmic, following (5.24). For superlinear preferential attachment (α
> 1) the biggest hub grows linearly with time, always grabbing a ﬁnite fraction of all links, following
(5.25). The symbols are provided by numerical simulations; the dotted lines represent the analytical
predictions.

For α = 1 we recover the Barabási-Albert model, obtaining a scale-free network with degree
distribution (5.14).

Next we focus on the case α ≠ 0 and α ≠ 1. The calculation of pk for an arbitrary α predicts several
scaling regimes [13] (ADVANCED TOPICS 5.B):

Sublinear Preferential Attachment (0 < α < 1)
For any α > 0 new nodes favor the more connected nodes over the less connected nodes. Yet, for
α < 1 the bias is weak, not sufficient to generate a scale-free degree distribution. Instead, in this
regime the degrees follow the stretched exponential distribution (SECTION 4.10)

Sublinear preferential attachment also alters the size of the largest degree, kmax. For a scale-free
network kmax scales polynomially with time, following (4.18). For sublinear preferential
attachment we have

∼ (ln t

kmax
a logarithmic dependence that predicts a much slower growth of the maximum degee than the
polynomial. This slower growth is the reason why the hubs are smaller for α < 1 (Image 5.11).

(5. 24)

Superlinear Preferential Attachment (α > 1)
For α > 1 the tendency to link to highly connected nodes is enhanced, accelerating the rich-gets-
richer process. The consequence of this is most obvious for α > 2, when the model predicts a
winner-takes-all phenomenon: almost all nodes connect to a few super-hubs. Hence we observe
the emergence of a hub-and-spoke network, in which most nodes link directly to a few central
nodes. The situation for 1 < α < 2 is less extreme, but similar.

This winner-takes-all process alters the size of the largest hub as well, finding that (Image 5.11).

∼ t

kmax
In summary, nonlinear preferential attachment changes the degree distribution, either limiting
the size of the hubs (α < 1), or leading to super- hubs (α > 1, Image 5.12). Consequently, Π(k)
needs to depend strictly linearly on the degrees for the resulting network to have a pure power
law pk. While in many systems we do observe such a linear dependence, in others, like the
scientific collaboration network and the actor network, preferential attachment is sublinear.
This nonlinear Π(k) is one reason the degree distribution of real networks deviates from a pure
power-law. Hence for systems with sublinear Π(k) the stretched exponential (5.23) should offer
a better fit to the degree distribution.

The Origins of Preferential Attachment

Given the key role preferential attachment plays in the evolution of real networks, we must ask,
where does it come from? The question can be broken to two narrower issues:

Why does Π(k) depend on k?

Why is the dependence of Π(k) linear in k?

In the past decade we witnessed the emergence of two philosophically different answers to
these questions. The first views preferential attachment as the interplay between random
events and some structural property of a network. These mechanisms do not require global
knowledge of the network but rely on random events, hence we will call them local or random
mechanisms. The second assumes that each new node or link balances conflicting needs, hence
they are preceeded by a cost-benefit analysis. These models assume familiarity with the whole
network and rely on optimization principles, prompting us to call them global or optimized
mechanisms. In this section we discuss both approaches.

Local Mechanisms

The Barabási-Albert model postulates the presence of preferential attachment. Yet, as we show
below, we can build models that generate scalefree networks apparently without preferential
attachment. They work by generating preferential attachment. Next we discuss two such models
and derive Π(k) for them, allowing us to understand the origins of preferential attachment.

Link Selection Model
• The network grows by adding a new node, that selects randomly a link from the network (shown in
purple).
• The new node connects with equal probability to one of the two nodes at the ends of the selected
link. In this case the new node connected to the node at the right end of the selected link.

Link Selection Model
The link selection model offers perhaps the simplest example of a local mechanism that generates
a scale-free network without preferential attachment [16]. It is defined as follows (Image 5.13):

• Growth: At each time step we add a new node to the network.
• Link Selection: We select a link at random and connect the new node to one of the two nodes at
the two ends of the selected link. The model requires no knowledge about the overall network
topology, hence it is inherently local and random. Unlike the Barabási-Albert model, it lacks a
built-in Π(k) function. Yet, next we show that it generates preferential attachment.

We start by writing the probability qk that the node at the end of a randomly chosen link has
degree k as

pk

= Ck

qk
Equation (5.26) captures two effects:

(5. 26)

• The higher is the degree of a node, the higher is the chance that it is located at the end of the
chosen link.
• The more degree-k nodes are in the network (i.e., the higher is pk), the more likely that a
degree k node is at the end of the link.

In (5.26) C can be calculated using the normalization condition Σqk = 1, obtaining C=1/〈k〉. Hence
the probability to find a degree-k node at the end of a randomly chosen link is

Copying Model
While the link selection model offers the simplest mechanism for preferential attachment, it is
neither the first nor the most popular in the class of models that rely on local mechanisms. That
distinction goes to the copying model (Image 5.14). The model mimics a simple phenomena: The
authors of a new webpage tend to borrow links from other webpages on related topics [17, 18]. It
is defined as follows:

Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
In each time step a new node is added to the network. To decide where it connects we randomly
select a node u, corresponding for example to a web document whose content is related to the
content of the new node. Then we follow a two-step procedure (Image 5.14):

  

•  Random Connection: With probability p the new node links to u, which means that we link to
the randomly selected web document.
•  Copying: With probability 1-p we randomly choose an outgoing link of node u and link the new
node to the link’s target. In other words, the new webpage copies a link of node u and connects to
its target, rather than connecting to node u directly.

The probability of selecting a particular node in step (i) is 1/N. Step (ii) is equivalent with
selecting a node linked to a randomly selected link. The probability of selecting a degree-k node
through this copying step (ii) is k/2L for undirected networks. Combining (i) and (ii), the
likelihood that a new node connects to a degree-k node follows

The popularity of the copying model lies in its relevance to real systems:

•  Social Networks: The more acquaintances an individual has, the higher is the chance that she
will be introduced to new individuals by her existing acquaintances. In other words, we "copy"
the friends of our friends. Consequently without friends, it is difficult to make new friends.
•  Citation Networks: No scientist can be familiar with all papers published on a certain topic.
Authors decide what to read and cite by "copying" references from the papers they have read.
Consequently papers with more citations are more likely to be studied and cited again.
• Protein Interactions: Gene duplication, responsible for the emergence of new genes in a cell, can
be mapped into the copying model, explaining the scale-free nature of protein interaction
networks [19, 20].

Taken together, we find that both the link selection model and the copying model generate a
linear preferential attachment through random linking.

Optimization

A longstanding assumption of economics is that humans make rational decisions, balancing
cost against benefits. In other words, each individual aims to maximize its personal advantage.
This is the starting point of rational choice theory in economics [21] and it is a hypothesis
central to modern political science, sociology, and philosophy. As we show below, such rational

Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
Consider the Internet, whose nodes are routers connected via cables. Establishing a new
Internet connection between two routers requires us to lay down a new cable between them. As
this is costly, each new link is preceded by a careful cost-benefit analysis. Each new router
(node) will choose its link to balance access to good network performance (i.e. proper bandwith)
with the cost of laying down a new cable (i.e. physical distance). This can be a conflicting desire,
as the closest node may not offer the best network performance

For simplicity let us assume that all nodes are located on a continent with the shape of a unit
square. At each time step we add a new node and randomly choose a point within the square as
its physical location. When deciding where to connect the new node i, we calculate the cost
function [22]

Euclidean distance between the new node i and the potential target j, and hj is the network-
based distance of node j to the ﬁrst node of the network, which we designate as the desireable
“center“ of the network (Image 5.15), offering the best network performance. Hence hj captures
the “resources” offered by node j, measured by its distance to the network’s center.

Optimization Model
(a)A small network, where the hj term in the cost function (5.28) is shown for each node. Here hj
represents the network-based distance of node j from node i=0, designated as the "center" of the
network, offering the best network performance. Hence h0=0 and h3=2.

(b)A new node (green) will choose the node j to which it connects by minimizing Cj of (5.28).

(c)-(e) If δ is small the new node will connect to the central node with hj =0. As we increase δ, the
balance in (5.28) shifts, forcing the new node to connect to more distant nodes. The panels (c)-(e)
show the choice of the new green node makes for different values of δ.

(f) The basin of attraction for each node for δ=10. A new node arriving inside a basin will always link to
the node at the center of the basin. The size of each basin depends on the degree of the node at its
center. Indeed, the smaller is hj, the larger can be the distance to the new node while still minimizing
(5.28). Yet, the higher is the degree of node j, the smaller is its expected distance to the central node hj.

The calculations indicate the emergence of three distinct network topologies, depending on the
value of the parameter δ in (5.28) and N (Image 5.15):

Star Network δ < (1/2)1/2
For δ = 0 the Euclidean distances are irrelevant, hence each node links to the central node,
turning the network into a star. We have a star configuration each time when the hj term
dominates over δdij in (5.28).

Random Network δ ≥ N1/2
For very large δ the contribution provided by the distance term δdij overwhelms hj in (5.28). In
this case each new node connects to the node closest to it. The resulting network will have a
bounded degree distribution, like a random network (Image 5.16b).

Scale-free Network 4 ≤ δ ≤ N1/2
Numerical simulations and analytical calculations indicate that for intermediate δ values the
network develops a scale-free topology [22]. The origin of the power law distribution in this
regime is rooted in two competing mechanisms:

•  Randomness: We choose randomly the location of the new node, ending in one of the N basins
of attraction. The node with the largest degree has largest basin of attraction, hence gains the
most new nodes and links. This leads to preferential attachment, as documented in Image 5.16d.

Scaling in the Optimization Model
•  The three network classes generated by the optimization model: star, scale-free, and exponential
networks. The topology of the network in the unmarked area is unknown.
The vertical boundary of the star conﬁguration is at δ=(1/2)1/2. This is the inverse of the maximum
distance between two nodes on a square lattice with unit length, over which the model is deﬁned.
Therefore if δ < (1/2)1/2, for any new node δdij< 1 and the cost (5.28) of connecting to the central node is
Ci = δdij+0, always lower than connecting to any other node at the cost of f(i,j) = δdij+1. Therefore for δ <
(1/2)1/2 all nodes connect to node 0, resulting in a network dominated by a single hub (starand-spoke
network (c)).
The oblique boundary of the scale-free regime is δ = N1/2. Indeed, if nodes are placed randomly on the
unit square, then the typical distance between neighbors decreases as N−1/2. Hence, if dij~N−1/2 then
δdij≥hij for most node pairs. Typically the path length to the central node hj grows slower than N (in
small-world networks hj~log N, in scale-free networks hj~lnlnN). Therefore Ci is dominated by the δdij
term and the smallest Ci is achieved by minimizing the distance-dependent term. Note that strictly
speaking the transition only occurs in the N → ∞ limit. In the white regime we lack an analytical form for
the degree distribution.
•  Degree distribution of networks generated in the three phases marked in (a) for N=104.
•  Typical topologies generated by the optimization model for selected δ values. Node size is
proportional to its degree.
•  We used the method described in SECTION 5.6 to measure the preferential attachment function.
Starting from a network with N=10,000 nodes we added a new node and measured the degree of the
node that it connected to. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times, obtaining Π(k). The plots
document the presence of linear preferential attachment in the scale-free phase, but its absence in the
star and the exponential phases.

In summary, we can build models that do not have an explicit Π(k) function built into their
definition, yet they generate a scale-free network. As we showed in this section, these work by
inducing preferential attachment. The mechanism responsible for preferential attachment can
have two fundamentally different origins (Image 5.17): it can be rooted in random processes, like
link selection or copying, or in optimization, when new nodes balance conflicting criteria as they
decide where to connect. Note that each of the mechanisms discussed above lead to linear
preferential attachment, as assumed in the Barabási-Albert model. We are not aware of
mechanisms capable of generating nonlinear preferential attachment, like those discussed in
SECTION 5.7.

The tension between randomness and optimization, two apparently antagonistic explanations for power

power-law nature of word frequencies. Mandelbrot ﬁercely defended an optimization-based framework.

Therefore the diameter grows slower than ln N, making the distances in the Barabási-Albert
model smaller than the distances observed in a random graph of similar size. The difference is
particularly relevant for large N.

Note that while (5.29) is derived for the diameter, the average distance 〈d〉 scales in a similar
fashion. Indeed, as we show in Image 5.18, for small N the ln N term captures the scaling of 〈d〉
with N, but for large N(≥104) the impact of the logarithmic correction ln ln N becomes
noticeable.

Summary

The most important message of the Barabási-Albert model is that network structure and
evolution are inseparable. Indeed, in the Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, the configuration and
the hidden parameter models the role of the modeler is to cleverly place the links between a
ﬁxed number of nodes. Returning to our earlier analogy, the networks generated by these models
relate to real networks like a photo of a painting relates to the painting itself: It may look like
the real one, but the process of generating a photo is drastically different from the process of
painting the original painting. The aim of the Barabási-Albert model is to capture the processes
that assemble a network in the first place. Hence, it aims to paint the painting again, coming as
close as possible to the original brush strokes. Consequently, the modeling philosophy behind

Random networks, the configuration and the hidden parameter models will continue to play an
important role as we explore how certain network characteristics deviate from our expectations.
Yet, if we want to explain the origin of a particular network property, we will have to use models
that capture the system’s genesis.

The Barabási-Albert model raises a fundamental question: Is the combination of growth and
preferential attachment the real reason why networks are scale-free? We offered a necessary and
suﬃcient argument to address this question. First, we showed that growth and preferential
attachment are jointly needed to generate scale-free networks, hence if one of them is absent,
either the scale-free property or stationarity is lost. Second, we showed that if they are both
present, they do lead to scale-free networks. This argument leaves one possibility open,
however: Do these two mechanisms explain the scale-free nature of all networks? Could there
be some real networks that are scale-free thanks to some completely different mechanism? The
answer is provided in SECTION 5.9, where we did encountered the link selection, the copying
and the optimization models that do not have a preferential attachment function built into
them, yet they do lead to a scale-free network. We showed that they do so by generating a linear
Π(k). This finding underscores a more general pattern: To date all known models and real
systems that are scale-free have been found to have preferential attachment. Hence the basic
mechanisms of the Barabási-Albert model appear to capture the origin of their scale-free
topology.

The Barabási-Albert model is unable to describe many characteristics of real systems:

•  The model predicts γ=3 while the degree exponent of real networks varies between 2 and 5
(Table 4.2).
• Many networks, like the WWW or citation networks, are directed, while the model generates
undirected networks.
•  Many processes observed in networks, from linking to already existing nodes to the
disappearance of links and nodes, are absent from the model.
•  The model does not allow us to distinguish between nodes based on some intrinsic
characteristics, like the novelty of a research paper or the utility of a webpage.
•  While the Barabási-Albert model is occasionally used as a model of the Internet or the cell, in
reality it is not designed to capture the details of any particular real network. It is a minimal,
proof of principle model whose main purpose is to capture the basic mechanisms responsible
for the emergence of the scale-free property. Therefore, if we want to understand the evolution
of systems like the Internet, the cell or the WWW, we need to incorporate the important details
that contribute to the time evolution of these systems, like the directed nature of the WWW, the
possibility of internal links and node and link removal.

Advanced Topic 4.A
Deriving the Degree Distribution

  

A number of analytical techniques are available to calculate the exact form of the degree
exponent (5.11). Next we derive it using the rate equation approach [12, 13]. The method is
sufficiently general to help explore the properties of a wide range of growing networks.
Consequently, the calculations described here are of direct relevance for many systems, from
models pertaining to the WWW [16, 17, 18] to describing the evolution of the protein interaction
network via gene duplication [19, 20].

Let us denote with N(k,t) the number of nodes with degree k at time t. The degree distribution
pk(t) relates to this quantity via pk(t) = N(k,t)/N(t). Since at each time-step we add a new node to
the network, we have N = t. That is, at any moment the total number of nodes equals the number
of timesteps (BOX 5.2).

We write preferential attachment as

Π(k) =

=

k
2mt

k
∑

(5. 31)

where the 2m term captures the fact that in an undirected network each link contributes to the
degree of two nodes. Our goal is to calculate the changes in the number of nodes with degree k
after a new node is added to the network. For this we inspect the two events that alter N(k,t) and
pk(t) following the arrival of a new node:

• A new node can link to a degree-k node, turning it into a degree (k+1) node, hence decreasing
N(k,t).
• A new node can link to a degree (k-1) node, turning it into a degree k node, hence increasing
N(k,t).

The number of links that are expected to connect to degree k nodes after the arrival of a new
node is

In (5.32) the first term on the l.h.s. captures the probability that the new node will link to a
degree-k node (preferential attachment); the second term provides the total number of nodes

Equations (5.35) and (5.36) are the starting point of the recursive process that provides pk. Let us
use the fact that we are looking for a stationary degree distribution, an expectation supported by
numerical simulations (Image 5.6). This means that in the N = t → ∞ limit, pk(∞)= pk. Using this
we can write the l.h.s. of (5.35) and (5.36) as

Advanced Topic 4.C
The Clustering Coefficient

  

In this section we derive the average clustering coefficient, (5.30), for the Barabási-Albert
model. The derivation follows an argument proposed by Klemm and Eguiluz [35], supported by
the exact calculation of Bollobás [36].

We aim to calculate the number of triangles expected in the model, which can be linked to the
clustering coefficient (SECTION 2.10). We denote the probability to have a link between node i
and j with P(i,j). Therefore, the probability that three nodes i, j, l form a triangle is
P(i,j)P(i,l)P(j,l). The expected number of triangles in which node l with degree kl participates is
thus given by the sum of the probabilities that node l participates in triangles with arbitrary
chosen nodes i and j in the network. We can use the continuous degree approximation to write

∫ N
i=1

djP(i, j)P(i, l)P(j, l)

N (◃) =
rl
To proceed we need to calculate P(i,j), which requires us to consider how the Barabási-Albert
model evolves. Let us denote the time when node j arrived with tj =j, which we can do as in each
time step we added only one new node (event time, BOX 5.2). Hence the probability that at its
arrival node j links to node i with degree ki is given by preferential attachment

P(i, j) = mΠ(

Section 6.1

Introduction

Founded six years after birth of the World Wide Web, Google was a latecomer to search. By the
late 1990s Alta Vista and Inktomi, two search engines with an early start, have dominated the
search market. Yet, the third mover Google soon not only became the leading search engine, but
acquired links at such an incredible rate that by 2000 became the biggest hub of the Web as well.
But it didn’t last: In 2011 Facebook, a youngster with Google’s standards, took over as the Web’s
biggest node.

The Web’s competitive landscape highlights an important limitation of our modeling
framework: None of the network models we encountered so far are able to account for it. Indeed,
in the Erdős-Rényi model the identity of the biggest node is driven entirely by chance. The
Barabási-Albert model offers a more realistic picture, predicting that each node increases its
degree following k(t) ~ t1/2. This means that the oldest node always has the most links, a
phenomena called the first mover’s advantage in the business literature. It also means that a
late node can never become the largest hubs.

In reality the growth rate of a node does not depend on its age alone. Instead webpages,
companies, or actors have intrinsic qualities that influence the rate at which they acquire links.
Some show up late and nevertheless grab an extraordinary number of links within a short
timeframe. Others rise early yet never quite make it. The goal of this chapter is to understand
how the differences in the node’s ability to acquire links affect the network topology. Going
beyond this competitive landscape, we also explore how other processes, like node and link
deletion (Image 6.1) or the aging of nodes, phenomena frequently observed in real networks,
change the way networks evolve and alter their topology. Our goal is to develop a self-consistent
theory of evolving networks that can be adjusted at will to predict the dynamics and the
topology of a wide range of real networks.

Garment District
The Garment District is a Manhattan neighborhood located between Fifth and Ninth Avenue, from 34th to
42nd Street. Since the early 20th century it has been the center for fashion manufacturing and design in
the United States. The Needle threading a button and the Jewish Tailor, two sculptures located in the
heart of the district, pay tribute to the neighborhood’s past.

The garment industry of New York City offers a prominent example of a declining network, helping us
understand how the loss of nodes shapes a network’s topology (BOX 6.5). Uncovering the impact of
processes like node and link loss on the network topology is one of the goals of this chapter.

The Bianconi-Barabási Model

Some people have a knack for turning each random encounter into a lasting social link; some
companies turn each consumer into a loyal partner; some webpages turn visitors into addicts. A
common feature of these successful nodes is some intrinsic property that propels them ahead of
the pack. We will call this property ﬁtness.

Fitness is an individual’s gift to turn a random encounter into a lasting friendship; it is a
company’s knack to acquire consumers relative to its competition; it is a webpage’s ability to
bring us back on a daily basis despite the many other pages that compete for our attention.
Fitness may have genetic roots in people, it may be related to innovativeness and management

Video 6.1
The Bianconi-Barabási Model
The movie shows a growing network in which each new node acquires a randomly chosen ﬁtness
parameter at birth, indicated by the color of the node. Each new node chooses the nodes it links to
following generalized preferential attachment (6.1), making a node’s growth rate proportional to its
ﬁtness. The node size is proportional to its degree, illustrating that with time the nodes with the highest
ﬁtness turn into the largest hubs. Video courtesy of Dashun Wang.

In the Barabási-Albert model we assumed that a node’s growth rate is determined solely by its
degree. To incorporate the role of fitness we assume that preferential attachment is driven by
the product of a node’s fitness, η, and its degree k. The resulting model, called the Bianconi-
Barabási or the ﬁtness model, consists of the following two steps [2, 3]:

•  Growth
In each timestep a new node j with m links and fitness ηj is added to the network, where ηj is a
random number chosen from a fitness distribution ρ(η). Once assigned, a node’s fitness does
not change.

The probability that a link of a new node connects to node i is proportional to the product of

(6. 1)

In (6.1) the dependence of Πi on ki captures the fact that higher-degree nodes have more
visibility, hence we are more likely to link to them. The dependence of Πi on ηi implies that
between two nodes with the same degree, the one with higher fitness is selected with a higher
probability. Hence, (6.1) assures that even a relatively young node, with initially only a few links,
can acquire links rapidly if it has larger fitness than the rest of the nodes.

We can use the continuum theory to predict each node’s temporal evolution. According to (6.1),
the degree of node i changes at the rate

In the Barabási-Albert model we have β = 1/2, hence the degree of each node increases as a
square root of time. According to (6.4), in the Bianconi-Barabási model the dynamic exponent is
proportional to the node’s fitness, η, hence each node has its own dynamic exponent.
Consequently, a node with a higher fitness will increase its degree faster. Given sufficient time,
the fitter node will leave behind nodes with a smaller fitness (Image 6.2). Facebook is a poster
child of this phenomenon: a latecomer with an addictive product, it acquired links faster than its
competitors, eventually becoming the Web’s biggest hub.

node joins the network, the larger is its degree at any time. The ﬁgure shows the time dependent degree
of nodes that arrived at different times (ti = 1,000, 3000, 5000), demonstrating that the later nodes are
unable to pass the earlier nodes [4, 5].

individual ﬁtness. Hence a latecomer node with a higher ﬁtness (purple symbols) can overcome the
earlier nodes.
•  Same as in (c) but on a log-log plot, demonstrating that each node increases its degree following a

Equation (6.6) is a weighted sum of multiple power-laws, indicating that pk depends on the
precise form of the fitness distribution, ρ(η). To illustrate the properties of the model we use
(6.4) and (6.6) to calculate β(η) and pk for two fitness distributions

(6. 6)

•  Equal Fitnesses
When all fitnesses are equal, the Bianconi-Barabási model reduces to the Barabási-Albert
model. Indeed, let us use ρ(η) = δ(η − 1), capturing the fact that each node has the same fitness η
= 1. In this case (6.5) yields C = 2. Using (6.4) we obtain β = 1/2 and (6.6) predicts pk ~ k−3, the
known scaling of the degree distribution in the Barabási-Albert model.
•  Uniform Fitness Distribution
The model’s behavior is more interesting when nodes have different fitnesses. Let us choose η
to be uniformly distributed in the [0,1] interval. In this case C is the solution of the
transcendental equation (6.5)
exp(−2/C) = 1 − 1/C
whose numerical solution is C* = 1.255. Consequently, (6.4) predicts that each node i has a
different dynamic exponent, β(ηi) = ηi /C*.

predicting that the degree distribution follows a power law with degree exponent γ = 2.255. Yet,
we do not expect a perfect power law, but the scaling is affected by an inverse logarithmic
correction 1/lnk.

Numerical support for the above predictions is provided in Figures 6.2 and 6.3. The simulations
confirm that ki(t) follows a power law for each η and that the dynamical exponent β(η) increases
with the fitness η. As Image 6.3a indicates, the measured dynamical exponents are in excellent
agreement with the prediction (6.4). Image 6.3b also documents an agreement between (6.8)

•  Degree distribution of the model obtained numerically for a network with m=2 and N = 106 and

(6.8) with γ = 2.255. The long-dashed line is pk ~ k−2.255 without the logarithmic correction, while the

provided by (6.8).

In (a)-(d) each curve corresponds to average over 100 independent runs using the same ﬁtness
sequence.

In summary, the Bianconi-Barabási model can account for the fact that nodes with different
internal characteristics acquire links at different rates. It predicts that a node’s growth rate is
determined by its fitness η and allows us to calculate the dependence of the degree distribution
on the fitness distribution ρ(η).

Section 6.3

Measuring Fitness

Measuring a node’s fitness could help us identify web sites that are poised to grow in visibility,
research papers that will become influential, or actors on their way to stardom (BOX 6.1). Yet,
our ability to determine the fitness is prone to errors. Consider the challenge of assigning
fitness to a webpage on sumo wrestling: While a small segment of the population might find
sumo wrestling fascinating, most individuals are indifferent to it and some might even find it

Box 6.1

The Genetic Origins of Fitness

Could fitness, an ability to acquire friends in a social network, have genetic origins? To
answer this researchers examined the social network of 1,110 school-age twins, using a
technique developed to identify the heritability of traits and behaviors. They found that:

•  Genetic factors account for 46% of the variation in a student’s in-degree (i.e. the
number of students that name a given student a friend).
•  Generic factors are not significant for out-degrees (i.e. the number of students a
particular student names as friends).

This suggests that an individual’s ability to acquire links, or its fitness, is heritable. In
other words, in social networks fitness has genetic origins. This conclusion is also
supported by research that associated a particular genetic trait with variations in
popularity [8].

According to (6.1) fitness is not assigned by any individual, but reflects the network’s collective
perception of a node’s importance relative to the other nodes. We can, therefore, determine a node’s
fitness by comparing its time evolution to the time evolution of other nodes in the network. In
this section we show that if we have dynamical information about the evolution of the individual
nodes, the quantitative framework of the BianconiBarabási model allows us to determine the
fitness of each node.

To relate a node’s growth rate to its fitness we take the logarithm of (6.3),

linear function of the dynamical exponent β(ηi). In turn β(ηi) depends linearly on ηi according to
(6.4). Therefore, if we can track the time evolution of the degree for a large number of nodes, the
distribution of the dynamical exponent β(ηi) will be identical with the fitness distribution ρ(η).

The Fitness of a Web Document

Node fitnesses were systematically measured in the context of the WWW, relying on a dataset
that crawled monthly the links of about 22 million web documents for 13 months [9]. While
most nodes (documents) did not change their degree during this time frame, 6.5% of nodes

The measurements indicate that each node’s degree has a power law time dependence, as predicted by

constant according to (6.4). The plot shows the result of two measurements based on datasets
recorded three months apart, demonstrating that the ﬁtness distribution is time independent. The
dashed line suggests that the ﬁtness distribution is well approximated by an exponential. After [9].

The shape of the obtained fitness distribution is somewhat unexpected, as one would be
tempted to assume that on the web fitness varies widely: For example Google is far more
attrative to Web surfers than my personal webpage. Yet the exponential form of ρ(η)ρ indicates
that the fitness of Web documents is bounded, varying in a relativelly narrow range.
Consequently, the observed large differences in the degree of two web documents is generated

To illustrate this amplification, consider two nodes that arrived at the same time, but have

degrees grows for large t as

The Fitness of a Scientific Publication

In some networks the nodes follow a more complex dynamics than the one predicted by (6.3). To
measure their fitness we must first account for their precise growth law. We illustrate this
procedure by determining the fitness of a research publication, allowing us to predict its future
impact.

While most research papers acquire only a few citations, a small number of publications collect
thousands and even tens of thousands of citations [10]. These impact differences mirror
differences in the novelty and the relevance of various publications. In general, the probability

Equation (6.13) predicts that the citation history of paper i is characterized by three parameters:
the immediacy µi, governing the time for a paper to reach its citation peak and the longevity σi,
capturing the decay rate. The most important is the relative fitness ηi′ ≡ ηi β/A, which measures a
paper’s importance relative to other papers and determines its ultimate impact (BOX 6.2).

We fit (6.13) to the citation history of individual papers published by a journal to obtain the
journal’s fitness distribution (Image 6.5). The measurements indicate that the fitness
distribution of the top cell biology journal, Cell, is shifted to the right, indicating that Cell papers
tend to have high fitness. Not surprisingly, the journal has one of the highest impact factors of
all journals. By comparison the fitness of papers published in Physical Review are shifted to the
left, indicating that the journal publishes fewer high fitness papers.

In summary, the framework offered by the Bianconi-Barabási model allows us to determine the
fitness of individual nodes and the shape of the fitness distribution ρ(η). The measurements
show that the fitness distribution is typically exponentially bounded, meaning that fitness
differences between different nodes are small. With time these differences are magnified,
resulting in a power law degree distribution of incoming links in the case of the WWW or a broad
citation distribution in citation networks.

early impact of the two papers cannot be more different: According to the Web of Science, two
years after publication the much anticipated human genome paper collected over 1,400 citations;
in contrast the scale-free network paper was cited only 120 times. Their long-term citation
dynamics is also remarkably different: The citations of the human genome paper peaked after
year two, a pattern shared by more than 85% of all research papers. In contrast the yearly
citations to the scale-free paper continued to increase for about a decade.

The continuous curves corresponding to the ﬁt (6.13) to the respective citation history, allowing
us to determine the paper’s future citations and its ultimate impact. The ultimate impact
corresponds to the total area under each curve for t → ∞. According to (6.15) the ultimate impact
of the human genome paper is 13,105, while that of the scale-free paper is 26,183. Therefore the
early citation count of a paper is not a strong indicator of its ultimate impact.

Citation counts offer only the historical impact of a research paper. They do not tell us,
however, if the paper has already had its run, or its impact will continue to grow. To gauge
a paper’s true impact we need to determine how many citations a paper acquires during its
lifetime. The citation model (6.11) and (6.14) allows us to predict this ultimate impact.

Bose-Einstein Condensation

In the previous section we found that the Web’s fitness distribution follows a simple
exponential (Image 6.4), while the fitness of research papers follows a peaked distribution
(Image 6.5). The diversity of the observed fitness distributions raises an important question:
How does the network topology depend on the shape of ρ(η)?

Technically, the answer is provided by (6.6) that links pk to ρ(η). Yet, the true impact of the
fitness distribution was realized only after the discovery that some networks can undergo Bose-
Einstein condensation. In the section we discuss the mapping that lead to this discovery and its
consequences for the network topology [15].

We start by establishing a formal link between the Bianconi-Barabási model and a Bose gas,
whose properties have been extensively studied in physics (Image 6.7):

In physical systems βT plays the role of the inverse temperature. We use the subscript T to
distinguish βT from the dynamic exponent β. According to (6.16), each node in a network
corresponds to an energy level in a Bose gas. The larger the node’s fitness, the lower is its
energy.
•  Links → Particles
For each link from node i to node j we add a particle at the energy level εj.
•  Nodes → Energy levels
The arrival of a new node with m links corresponds to adding a new energy level εj and m new
particles to the Bose gas, placed on the energy levels of the nodes to which the new node links
to.

Mapping Networks to a Bose Gas
Network
A network of six nodes, where each node is characterized by a unique ﬁtness ηi indicated by the node
color. The ﬁtnesses are chosen from the ﬁtness distribution ρ(η).

Bose Gas
The mapping assigns an energy level ε to each ﬁtness η, resulting in a Bose gas with random energy
levels. A link going from a new node i to node j corresponds to one particle at level εj.

Growth
The network grows by adding a new node, like the orange node with ﬁtness η6. For m=1 the new node
connects to the grey node (dashed link), chosen following (6.1). In the Bose gas this corresponds to the
addition of a new energy level ε6 (dashed line), and the deposition of a particle at ε1, the energy level of
node 1 to which node η6 links to.

For most fitness distributions the network displays a fit-gets-rich dynamics, meaning that the
Network Science
degree of each node is ultimately determined by its fitness. While the fittest node inevitably
by Albert-László Barabási
becomes the largest hub, in this phase at any moment the degree distribution follows a power
law, indicating that the generated network has a scalefree topology. Consequently the largest
hub follows (4.18), growing only sublinearly. This hub is closely trailed by a few slightly smaller
hubs, with almost as many links as the fittest node (Image 6.9a). The model with uniform
fitness distribution discussed in SECTION 6.2 is in this scale-free phase.

  

Bose-Einstein Condensation

The unexpected outcome of the mapping to a Bose gas is the possibility of a Bose-Einstein
condensation for some fitness distributions. In a Bose-Einstein condensate all particles crowd
to the lowest energy level, leaving the rest of the energy levels unpopulated (BOX 6.4).

In a network Bose-Einstein condensation means that the fittest node grabs a finite fraction of
the links, turning into a super-hub (Image 6.9b). The resulting network is not scale-free but has
a huband-spoke topology. In this phase the rich-gets-richer process is so dominant that it
becomes a qualitatively different winner takes-all phenomenon. Consequently, the network will
loose its scale-free nature.

In physical systems Bose-Einstein condensation is induced by lowering the temperature of the
Bose gas below some critical temperature (BOX 6.4). In networks, the temperature βT in (6.16) is
a dummy variable, disappearing from all topologically relevant quantities, like the degree
distribution pk. Hence, the presence or the absence of Bose-Einstein condensation depends only
on the form of the fitness distribution ρ(η). For a network to undergo Bose-Einstein
condensation, the fitness distribution needs to satisfy the condition

ηmax ηρ(η)
∫
1−η

dη < 1

A fitness distribution that leads to a Bose-Einstein condensation is

(6. 22)

ρ(η) = (1 − ζ)(1 − η
)ζ
whereby varying ζ we can induce a Bose-Einstein condensation (Image 6.9). Indeed, whether
(6.20) has a solution depends on the functional form of the energy distribution, g(ε), which is
determined by the shape of ρ(η). Specifically, if (6.22) has no non-negative solution for a given
g(ε), a Bose-Einstein condensation emerges, and a finite fraction of the particles agglomerate at
the lowest energy level.

In classical physics the kinetic energy of a moving particle, E= mv2/2, can have any value
between zero (at rest) and an arbitrarily large E, when it moves very fast. Furthermore, an
arbitrary number of particles can have the same energy E, if they have the same velocity v.
In quantum mechanics energy is quantized, meaning that it can only take up discrete
(quantized) values. Furthermore, in quantum mechanics we encounter two different
classes of particles. Fermi particles, like electrons, are forbidden to have the same energy
within the same system. Hence, only one electron can occupy a given energy level (Image
6.8b). In contrast Bose particles, like photons, are allowed to crowd in arbitrary numbers
on the same energy level (Image 6.8b).

At high temperatures, when thermal agitation forces the particles to take up different
energies, the difference between a Fermi and a Bose gas is negligible (Image 6.8a,b). The
difference becomes significant at low temperatures when all particles are forced to take
up their lowest allowed energy. In a Fermi gas at low temperatures the particles fill the
energy levels from bottom up, just like pouring water fills up a vase (Image 6.8c).
However, as any number of Bose particles can share the same energy, they can all crowd
at the lowest energy level (Image 6.8d>). In other words, no matter how much “Bose
liquid” we pour into the vase, it will stay at the bottom of the vessel, never filling it up.
This phenomenon is called a Bose-Einstein condensation and it was first proposed by
Einstein in 1924. Experimental evidence for Bose-Einstein condensation emerged only in
1995 and was recognized with the 2001 Nobel prize in physics.

In a Fermi gas (a,c) only one particle is allowed on each energy level, while in a Bose gas (b,d)
there is no such a restriction. At high temperatures it is hard to notice any difference between the
two gases. At low temperatures, however, each particle wants to occupy the lowest possible
energy and the difference between the two gases becomes signiﬁcant.

In summary, the precise shape of the fitness distribution determines the topology of a growing
network. While fitness distributions like the uniform distribution lead to a scale-free topology,
some ρ(η) allow for Bose-Einstein condensation. If a network undergoes a Bose-Einstein
condensation, then one or a few nodes grab most of the links. Hence, the rich-gets-richer
process responsible for the scale-free state turns into a winner-takes-all phenomenon. The

Evolving Networks

The Barabási-Albert model is a minimal model, designed to capture the mechanisms
responsible for the emergence of the scale-free property. Consequently, it has several well-
known limitations (see also SECTION 5.10):

•  The model predicts γ = 3, while the experimentally observed degree exponents vary between 2

•  The model predicts a power-law degree distribution, while in real systems we observe
systematic deviations from a pure power-law function, like small-degree saturation or high-
degree cutoff (BOX 4.8).
•  The model ignores a number of elementary processes that are obviously present in many real
networks, like the addition of internal links and node or link removal.

These limitations have inspired considerable research, clarifying the role of the numerous
elementary processes that influence the network topology. In this section we systematically
extend the Barabási-Albert model, arriving to a family of evolving network models that can
capture the wide range of phenomena known to shape the topology of real networks.

Initial Attractiveness

In the Barabási-Albert model an isolated node cannot acquire links, as according to preferential
attachment (4.1) the likelihood that a new node attaches to a k=0 node is strictly zero. In real
networks even isolated nodes acquire links. Indeed, each new research paper has a finite
probability of being cited for the first time; a person that moves to a new city quickly acquires
acquaintances. To allow unconnected nodes to acquire links we add a constant to the
preferential attachment function (4.1),

∼ A + k

Πk
Here the constant A is called initial attractiveness. As Π(0) ~ A, initialattractiveness is
proportional to the probability that a node acquires its first link in the next time step.

methodology described in SECTION 5.6. The continuous line corresponds to initial attractiveness A ~ 7.0,

the probability of a new paper to be cited for the ﬁrst time is comparable to the citation probability of a

Direct measurement of Π(k) shows that initial attractiveness is present in real networks (Image

•  Increases the Degree Exponent
If in the Barabási-Albert model we replace (4.1) with (6.23), the degree exponent becomes [17,
18]
γ = 3 +
Consequently initial attractiveness increases γ, making the network more homogeneous and
reducing the size of the hubs. Indeed, initial attractiveness adds a random component to the
probability of attaching to a node. This random component favors the numerous small-degree

•  Generates a Small-degree Saturation
The solution of the continuum equation indicates that the degree distribution of a network
governed by (6.23) does not follow a pure power-law, but has the form
pk
Therefore, initial attractiveness induces a small-degree saturation for k < A, playing the role of
ksat in (4.39). This saturation is rooted in the fact that initial attractiveness enhances the
probability that new nodes link to the small-degree nodes, which pushes the small-k nodes

towards higher degrees. For high degrees (k ≫ A) the degree distribution continues to follow a

Internal Links

In many networks new links do not only arrive with new nodes but are added between pre-
existing nodes. For example, the vast majority of new links on the WWW are internal links,
corresponding to newly added URLs between pre-existing web documents. Similarly, virtually
all new social/friendship links form between individuals that already have other friends and
acquaintances.

Measurements show that in collaboration networks the internal links follow double preferential
attachment, i.e. the probability for a new internal link to connect nodes with degrees k and k’ is

•  Double Preferential Attachment (A=0)
Consider an extension of the Barabási-Albert model, where in each time step we add a new node
with m links, followed by n internal links, each selected with probability (6.26) with A=0.
Consequently the likelihood that a new link emerges is proportional to the degree of the nodes it
connects. The degree exponent of the resulting network is [21, 22]
γ = 2 +
indicating that γ is between 2 and 3. This means that double preferential attachment lowers the
degree exponent from 3 to 2, hence increasing the network’s heterogeneity. Indeed, by
preferentially connecting the hubs to each other, internal links make both hubs larger at the
expense of the smaller nodes.
•  Random Attachment (B=0)
In this case the internal links are blind to the degree of the nodes they connect. Consequently
the internal links are added between randomly chosen node pairs. Let us again consider the
Barabási-Albert model, where after each new node we add n links between randomly selected

each other.

Node Deletion

In many real systems nodes and links can disappear. For example, nodes are deleted from an
organizational network when employees leave the company or from the WWW when web
documents are removed. At the same time in some networks node removal is virtually
impossible (Image 6.11).

  

Soon after Schön published a paper reporting a groundbreaking discovery on single-molecule
semiconductors, researchers noticed that he reported for two experiments, carried out at different
temperatures, identical noise [24]. The ensuing questions prompted Lucent Technologies, which ran
Bell Labs where Schön worked, to start a formal investigation. Eventually Schön admitted falsifying data.
Several dozens of his papers, like the one whose citation pattern is shown in this ﬁgure, were retracted.

While the papers’ formal retraction lead to a dramatic drop in citations, the papers continue to be cited
after their ofﬁcial “deletion” from the literature, as seen in the ﬁgure above. This indicates that it is
virtually impossible to remove a node from the citation network.

To explore the impact of node removal, we start from the Barabási-Albert model. In each time
step we add a new node with m links and with rate r we remove a node. Depending on r, we
observe three distinct scaling regimes [25-30]:

2
1−r

(6. 29)

•  Scale-free Phase
For r < 1 the number of removed nodes is smaller than the number of new nodes, hence the
network continues to grow. In this case the network is scale-free with degree exponent
γ = 3 +
Hence, random node removal increases γ, homogenizing the network.
•  Exponential Phase
For r=1 nodes arrive and are removed at the same rate, hence the network has a fixed size
(N=constant). In this case the network will loose its scale-free nature. Indeed, for r→1 we have γ
→ ∞ in (6.29).
•  Declining Networks
For r > 1 the number of removed nodes exceeds the number of new nodes, hence the network
declines (BOX 6.5). Declining networks emerge in several areas. For example, Alzheimer’s
research focuses on the progressive loss of neurons with age and ecology explores the role of
gradual habitat loss [31-33]. A classical example of a declining network is the telegraph, that
dominated long distance communication in the second part of the 19th century and early 20th
century. It was once a growing network: In the United States the length of the telegraph lines
grew from 40 miles in 1846 to 23,000 in 1852. Yet, following the second World War, the
telegraph gradually disappeared.

Phase Transitions Induced by Node Removal
The coexistence of node removal with other elementary processes can lead to interesting topological
phase transitions. This is illustrated by a simple model in which the network’s growth is governed by
(6.23), and we also remove nodes with rate r [30]. The network displays three distinct phases, captured
by the phase diagram shown above, whose axes are the node removal rate r and initial attractiveness A:

Subcritical Node Removal: r < r*(A)
If the rate of node removal is under a critical value r*(A), shown as the white line on the ﬁgure, the
network will be scale-free.

Critical Node Removal: r=r*(A)
Once r reaches a critical value r*(A), the degree distribution turns into a stretched exponential (SECTION
4.A).

Exponential Networks: r> r*(A)
The network looses its scale-free nature, developing an exponential degree distribution.

Therefore, the coexistence of multiple elementary processes in a network can lead to sudden changes

transition from a scale-free to an exponential network.

The behavior of a network can be rather complex if node removal coexists with other elementary
processes. This is illustrated in Image 6.12, indicating that the joint presence of initial
attractiveness and node deletion induces phase transitions between scale-free and exponential
networks. Finally, note that node removal is not always random, but can depend on the removed
node’s degree (BOX 6.5).

In summary, in most networks nodes can disappear. Yet as long as the network continues to
grow, its scale-free nature can persist. The degree exponent depends, however, on the details
governing the node removal process.

Box 6.5

Declining Fashion Networks

The New York City garment industry offers a prominent example of a declining network
(Image 6.1). Its nodes are designers and contractors that are connected to each other by
the annual coproduction of lines of clothing. As the industry decayed, the network has
persistently shrunk: The network’s largest connected component collapsed from 3,249
nodes in 1985 to 190 nodes in 2003. Interestingly, the network’s degree distribution
remained unchanged during this period. The analysis of the network’s evolution
uncovered several properties of declining networks [25]:

•  Preferential Attachment
While overall the network was shrinking, new nodes continued to arrive. The
measurements indicate that the attachment probability of these new nodes follows Π(k) ~
kα with α=1.20 ± 0.06 (Image 6.13a), offering evidence of superlinear preferential
attachment (SECTION 5.7).
•  Link Deletion
The probability that a firm lost a link follows k(t)−η with η = 0.41 ± 0.04, i.e. it decreased
with the firms’ degree (Image 6.13b). This documents a weak-gets-weaker phenomenon,
when the less connected firms are more likely to loose links.

•  Link deletion. The probability of deleting a link from a degree-k node, relative to random link
removal. The dashed line has slope η=0.41. If link loss were to be random the relative probability

Accelerated Growth

In the models discussed so far the number of links increased linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words, we assumed that L=〈k〉N/2, where 〈k〉 is independent of time. This is a reasonable
assumption for many real networks. Yet, for some real networks the number of links grows
faster than N, a phenomena called accelerated growth. For example the average degree of the
Internet increased from 〈k〉=3.42 in November 1997 to 3.96 by December 1998 [34]; the WWW
increased its average degree from 7.22 to 7.86 during a five month interval [35, 36]; in metabolic
networks the average degree of the metabolites grows approximately linearly with the number
of metabolites [37]. To explore the consequences of accelerated growth let us assume that in a
growing network the number of links arriving with each new node follows [38-41]

Aging

In many real systems nodes have a limited lifetime. For example, actors have a finite
professional life span, defined as the period when they act in movies. So do scientists, whose
professional lifespan typically corresponds to the time frame during which they continue to
publish scientific papers. In these networks nodes do not disappear abruptly, but fade away
through a slow aging process, gradually reducing the rate at which they acquire new links
[42-45]. Capacity limitations can induce a similar phenomena: If nodes have finite resources to
handle links, once they approach their limit, they will stop accepting new links [43].

To understand the impact of aging we assume that the probability that a new node connects to
node i is Π(ki,t−ti), where ti is the time node i was added to the network. Hence, t−ti is the node’s
age. Aging is often modeled by choosing [42]

ti

Π(

where ν is a tunable parameter governing the dependence of the attachment probability on the
node’s age. Depending on the value of ν we can distinguish three scaling regimes:

(6. 32)

ti)−ν

•  Negative ν
If ν < 0, new nodes will link to older nodes. Hence, a negative ν enhances the role of preferential
attachment. In the extreme case ν → −∞ each new node connects to the oldest node, resulting in
a hub-and-spoke topology (Image 6.14a). The calculations show that the scale-free state
persists in this regime, but the degree exponent drops under 3 (Image 6.14e). Hence ν < 0 makes
the network more heterogeneous.
•  Positive ν
In this case new nodes are encouraged to attach to younger nodes. In the extreme case ν → ∞
each node will connect to its immediate predecessor (Image 6.14d). We do not need a very large ν
to experience the impact on aging: The degree exponent diverges as we approach ν=1 (Image
6.14e). Hence gradual aging homogenizes the network by shadowing the older hubs.
•  ν > 1
In this case the aging effect overcomes the role of preferential attachment, leading to the loss of
the scale-free property (Image 6.14d).

results highlight the true power of the evolving network paradigm: It allows us to address, using
a mathematically self-consistent and predictive framework, the impact of various processes on
the network topology and evolution.

Summary

  

As we showed in this chapter, rather diverse processes, from fitness to internal links and aging,
can influence the structure of real networks. Through them we learned how to use the theory of
evolving networks to predict the impact of various elementary events on a network’s topology
and evolution. The discussed examples allow us to draw a key conclusion: if we want to
understand the structure of a network we must ﬁrst get its dynamics right. The topology is the bonus of
this approach.

The developed tools allow us to reflect on a number of issues that we encountered in the past
chapters, from the correct fit to the degree distribution to the role of the different modeling
frameworks. Next we briefly discuss some of these issues.

Topological Diversity

In CHAPTER 4 we discussed the difficulties we encounter when we attempt to fit a pure power
law to the degree distribution of a real network. The roots of this problem became obvious in
this chapter: If we account for the real dynamical processes that contribute to the evolution of a
network, we expect systematic deviations from a pure power law. Indeed, we predicted several
analytical forms for the degree distribution:

•  Power-Law
A pure power-law emerges if a growing network is governed by linear preferential attachment
only, as predicted by the Barabási-Albert model. It is rare to observe such a pure power law in
real systems. This idealized model represents the starting point for understanding the degree
distribution of real networks.
•  Stretched Exponential
If preferential attachment is sublinear, the degree distribution follows a stretched exponential
(SECTION 5.7). A similar degree-distribution can also appear under node removal at the critical
point (Image 6.12).
•  Fitness-induced Corrections
In the presence of fitness the precise form of pk depends on the fitness distribution ρ(η), which
determines pk via (6.6). For example, a uniform fitness distribution induces a logarithmic
correction in pk as predicted by (6.8). Other forms of ρ(η) can lead to rather exotic forms for pk.
•  Small-degree Saturation
Initial attractiveness adds a random component to preferential attachment. Consequently, the
degree distribution develops a small-degree saturation, as seen in (6.24).
•  High-degree Cutoffs
Node and link removal, present in many real systems, can induce exponential high-degree
cutoffs in the degree distribution. Furthermore, random node-removal can deplete the small-

degree nodes, inducing a peak in pk.
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
In most real networks several of the elementary processes discussed in this chapter appear
together. For example, in the scientific collaboration network we have sublinear preferential
attachment with initial attractiveness and the links can be both external and internal. As
researchers have different creativity, fitness also plays a role, hence an accurate model requires
us to know the appropriate fitness distribution. Therefore, the degree distribution is expected to
display small degree saturation (thanks to initial attractiveness), stretched exponential cutoff at
high degrees (thanks to sublinear preferential attachment), and some unknown corrections due
to the particular form of the fitness distribution ρ(η).

  

In general if wish to obtain an accurate fit to the degree distribution, we first need to build a
generative model that analytically predicts the functional form of pk. Yet, in many systems
developing an accurate theory for pk may be an overkill. It is often sufficient, instead, to
establish if we are dealing with an exponentially bounded or a heavy tailed degree distribution
(SECTION 4.9), as the system’s properties will be primarily driven by this distinction.

Modeling Diversity

The results of this chapter also allow us to reflect on the role of the network models encountered
so far. We can categorize these models into three main classes (Table 6.1):

Static Models
The random network model of Erdős and Rényi (CHAPTER 3) and the small-world network
model of Watts and Strogatz (BOX 3.8) have a fixed number of nodes, prompting us to call them
static models. They both assume that the role of the network modeler is to place the links
between the nodes using some random algorithm. To explore their properties we need to rely on
combinatorial graph theory, developed by Erdős and Rényi. Both models predict a bounded
degree distribution.

Generative Models
The configuration and the hidden parameter models discussed in SECTION 4.8 generate
networks with a predefined degree distribution. Hence, these models are not mechanistic, in the
sense that they do not tell us why a network develops a particular degree distribution. Rather,
they help us understand how various network properties, from clustering to path lengths,
depend on the degree distribution.

Evolving Network Models
These models capture the mechanisms that govern the time evolution of a network. The most
studied example is the Barabási-Albert model, but equally insightful are the extensions
discussed in this chapter, from the Bianconi-Barabási model to models involving internal links,
aging, node and link deletion, or accelerated growth. These models are motivated by the

evolution, then the network’s topological characteristics follow from that. To explore the

properties of the networks generated by them, we need to use dynamical methods like the
continuum theory and the rate equation approach.

Each of these modeling frameworks have their important role in network theory. The Erdős-
Rényi model allows us to check if a certain network property could be explained by a pure
random connectivity pattern. If our interest is limited to the role of the network environment
on some phenomena, like spreading processes or network robustness, the generative models
offer an excellent starting point. If, however, we want to understand the origin of a network
property, we must resort to evolving network models, that capture the processes that built the
network in the first place.

The dynamic exponent β(η) is bounded, i.e. 0 < β(η) < 1, because a node can only increase its

Gere and Cindy Crawford (Image 7.1). An odd list, yet instantly recognizable to those immersed
in the headline-driven world of celebrity couples. They are Hollywood stars that are or were
married. Their weddings (and breakups) has drawn countless hours of media coverage and sold
millions of gossip magazines. Thanks to them we take for granted that celebrities marry each
other. We rarely pause to ask: Is this normal? In other words, what is the true chance that a
celebrity marries another celebrity?

Assuming that a celebrity could date anyone from a pool of about a hundred million (108) eligible

list of 1,000 other celebrities is only 10-5. Therefore, if dating were driven by random
encounters, celebrities would never marry each other.

are known by even more. They are hubs. Hence celebrity dating (Image 7.1) and joint board
memberships are manifestations of an interesting property of social network: hubs tend to have
ties to other hubs.

As obvious this may sound, this property is not present in all networks. Consider for example
the protein-interaction network of yeast, shown in Image 7.2. A quick inspection of the network
reveals its scale-free nature: numerous one- and two-degree proteins coexist with a few highly
connected hubs. These hubs, however, tend to avoid linking to each other. They link instead to
many small-degree nodes, generating a hub-and-spoke pattern. This is particularly obvious for
the two hubs highlighted in Image 7.2: they almost exclusively interact with small-degree
proteins.

largest hubs, with degrees k = 56 and k′ = 13. They both connect to many small degree nodes and avoid
linking to each other.

The network has N = 1,870 proteins and L = 2,277 links, representing one of the earliest protein

of yeast in table 4.1 represents a later map, hence it contains more nodes and links than the network

nodes kills the organism, hence they are called lethal or essential proteins. In contrast the organism can

A brief calculation illustrates how unusual this pattern is. Let us assume that each node chooses

randomly the nodes it connects to. Therefore the probability that nodes with degrees k and k′
by Albert-László Barabási
link to each other is

=

(7. 1)

pk,k ′
Equation (7.1) tells us that hubs, by the virtue of the many links they have, are much more likely
to connect to each other than to small degree nodes. Indeed, if k and k′ are large, so is pk,k’ .
Consequently, the likelihood that hubs with degrees k=56 and k’ = 13 have a direct link between
them is pk,k’ = 0.16, which is 400 times larger than p1,2 = 0.0004, the likelihood that a degree-
two node links to a degree-one node. Yet, there are no direct links between the hubs in Image
7.2, but we observe numerous direct links between small degree nodes.

Instead of linking to each other, the hubs highlighted in Image 7.2 almost exclusively connect to
degree one nodes. By itself this is not unexpected: We expect that a hub with degree k = 56
should link to N1p1, 56 ≈ 12 nodes with k = 1. The problem is that this hub connects to 46 degree
one neighbors, i.e. four times the expected number.

In summary, while in social networks hubs tend to “date” each other, in the protein interaction
network the opposite is true: The hubs avoid linking to other hubs, connecting instead to many
small degree nodes. While it is dangerous to derive generic principles from two examples, the
purpose of this chapter is to show that these patterns are manifestations of a general property
of real networks: they exhibit a phenomena called degree correlations. We discuss how to
measure degree correlations and explore their impact on the network topology.

Section 7.2

Assortativity and Disassortativity

Just by the virtue of the many links they have, hubs are expected to link to each other. In some
networks they do, in others they don’t. This is illustrated in Image 7.3, that shows three
networks with identical degree sequences but different topologies:

•  Neutral Network
Image 7.3b shows a network whose wiring is random. We call this network neutral, meaning that
the number of links between the hubs coincides with what we expect by chance, as predicted by
(7.1).
•  Assortative Network
The network of Image 7.3a has precisely the same degree sequence as the one in Image 7.3b. Yet,
the hubs in Image 7.3a tend to link to each other and avoid linking to small-degree nodes. At the
same time the small-degree nodes tend to connect to other small-degree nodes. Networks
displaying such trends are assortative. An extreme manifestation of this pattern is a perfectly

In general a network displays degree correlations if the number of links between the high and
low-degree nodes is systematically different from what is expected by chance. In other words,
the number of links between nodes of degrees k and k′ deviates from (7.1).

the network in (a) has numerous links between its hubs as well as between its small degree nodes.

(b,e) Neutral Networks
In neutral networks nodes link to each other randomly. Hence the density of links is symmetric around
the average degree, indicating the lack of correlations in the linking pattern.

In disassortative networks eij is higher along the secondary diagonal, indicating that hubs tend to
connect to small-degree nodes and small-degree nodes to hubs. Consequently these networks have a

The information about potential degree correlations is captured by the degree correlation matrix,
eij, which is the probability of finding a node with degrees i and j at the two ends of a randomly

In summary information about degree correlations is carried by the degree correlation matrix eij.

Measuring Degree Correlations

While eij contains the complete information about the degree correlations characterizing a
particular network, it is difficult to interpret its content. In this section is to introduce the
degree correlation function that offers a simpler way to quantify degree correlations.

Degree correlations capture the relationship between the degrees of nodes that link to each
other. One way to quantify their magnitude is to measure for each node i the average degree of
its neighbors (Image 7.5)

The degree correlation function calculates (7.6) for all nodes with degree k [4, 5]

quantify degree correlations we inspect the dependence of knn(k) on k.

Therefore, in a neutral network the average degree of a node’s neighbors is independent of the
node’s degree k and depends only on the global network characteristics 〈k〉 and 〈k2〉. So plotting
knn(k) in function of k should result in a horizontal line at 〈k2〉 / 〈k〉, as observed for the power
grid (Image 7.6b). Equation (7.9) also captures an intriguing property of real networks: our
friends are more popular than we are, a phenomenon called the friendship paradox (BOX 7.1).
•  Assortative Network
In assortative networks hubs tend to connect to other hubs, hence the higher is the degree k of a
node, the higher is the average degree of its nearest neighbors. Consequently for assortative
networks knn(k) increases with k, as observed for scientific collaboration networks (Image 7.6a).
•  Disassortative Network
In disassortative network hubs prefer to link to low-degree nodes. Consequently knn(k) decreases
with k, as observed for the metabolic network (Image 7.6c).

•  Disassortative Networks: µ < 0
For the metabolic network we obtain µ = − 0.76 ± 0.04 (Image 7.6c).

Box 7.1

Friendship Paradox

The friendship paradox makes a suprising statement: On average my friends are more
popular than I am [6,7]. This claim is rooted in (7.9), telling us that the average degree of a
node’s neighbors is not simply 〈k〉, but depends on 〈k2〉 as well.

Consider a random network, for which 〈k2〉 = 〈k〉(1 + 〈k〉). According to (7.9) knn(k) = 1+〈k〉.
Therefore the average degree of a node’s neighbors is always higher than the average
degree of a randomly chosen node, which is 〈k〉.

The gap between 〈k〉 and our friends’ degree can be particularly large in scale-free
networks, for which 〈k2〉 / 〈k〉 significantly exceeds 〈k〉 (Image 4.8). Consider for example
the actor network, for which 〈k2〉 / 〈k〉 = 565 (Table 4.1). In this network the average degree
of a node's friends is hundreds of times the degree of the node itself.

The friendship paradox has a simple origin: We are more likely to be friends with hubs
than with small-degree nodes, simply because hubs have more friends than the small
nodes.

In summary, the degree correlation function helps us capture the presence or absence of
Network Science
correlations in real networks. The knn(k) function also plays an important role in analytical
by Albert-László Barabási
calculations, allowing us to predict the impact of degree correlations on various network
characteristics (SECTION 7.6). Yet, it is often convenient to use a single number to capture the
magnitude of correlations present in a network. This can be achieved either through the
correlation exponent µ defined in (7.10), or using the degree correlation coefficient introduced in
BOX 7.2.

Box 7.2

Degree Correlation Coefficient

If we wish to characterize degree correlations using a single number, we can use either µ
or the degree correlation coeﬃcient. Proposed by Mark Newman [8,9], the degree
correlation coefficient is defined as

Hence r is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the degrees found at the two end of
the same link. It varies between −1 ≤ r ≤ 1: For r < 0 the network is assortative, for r = 0 the
network is neutral and for r > 0 the network is disassortative. For example, for the
scientific collaboration network we obtain r = 0.13, in line with its assortative nature; for
the protein interaction network r = −0.04, supporting its disassortative nature and for the
power grid we have r = 0.

The assumption behind the degree correlation coefficient is that knn(k) depends linearly
on k with slope r. In contrast the correlation exponent µ assumes that knn(k) follows the
power law (7.10). Naturally, both cannot be valid simultaneously. The analytical models of
SECTION 7.7 offer some guidance, supporting the validity of (7.10). As we show in
ADVANCED TOPICS 7.A, in general r correlates with µ.

Throughout this book we assumed that networks are simple, meaning that there is at most one
Network Science
link between two nodes (Figure 2.17). For example, in the email network we place a single link
by Albert-László Barabási
between two individuals that are in email contact, despite the fact that they may have
exchanged multiple messages. Similarly, in the actor network we connect two actors with a
single link if they acted in the same movie, independent of the number of joint movies. All
datasets discussed in Table 4.1 are simple networks.

In simple networks there is a puzzling conflict between the scale-free property and degree
correlations [10, 11]. Consider for example the scalefree network of Image 7.7a, whose two
largest hubs have degrees k = 55 and k' = 46. In a network with degree correlations ekk' the
expected number of links between k and k' is

Therefore, given the size of these two hubs, they should be connected to each other by two to
three links to comply with the network’s neutral nature. Yet, in a simple network we can have
only one link between them, causing a conflict between degree correlations and the scale-free
property. The goal of this section is to understand the origin and the consequences of this
conflict.

For small k and k' (7.14) predicts that Ekk’ is also small, i.e. we expect less than one link between
the two nodes. Only for nodes whose degree exceeds some threshold ks does (7.14) predict
multiple links. As we show in ADVANCED TOPICS 7.B, ks, called structural cutoff, scales as

In other words, nodes whose degree exceeds (7.15) have Ekk’ > 1, a conflict that as we show below
gives rise to degree correlations.

expected number of links between the nodes with degree 8 and 7 is 8x7/28 ≈ 2. Yet, if we do not allow
multi-links, there can only be one link between these two nodes, making the network structurally
disassortative.

  

In other words, nodes whose degree exceeds (7.15) have Ekk’ > 1, a conflict that as we show below
gives rise to degree correlations.

To understand the consequences of the structural cutoff we must first ask if a network has nodes
whose degrees exceeds (7.15). For this we compare the structural cutoff, ks, with the natural
cutoff, kmax, which is the expected largest degree in a network. According to (4.18), for a scale-
free network kmax ~ N1/γ-1 . Comparing kmax to ks allows us to distinguish two regimes:

•  No Stuctural Cutoff
For random networks and scale-free networks with γ ≥ 3 the exponent of kmax is smaller than
1/2, hence kmax is always smaller than ks. In other words the node size at which the structural
cutoff turns on exceeds the size of the biggest hub. Consequently we have no nodes for which
Ekk’ > 1. For these networks we do not have a conflict between degree correlations and the simple
network requirement.
•  Stuctural Disassortativity
For scale-fee networks with γ < 3 we have 1/(γ-1) > 1/2, i.e. ks can be smaller than kmax.
Consequently nodes whose degree is between ks and kmax can violate Ekk’ > 1. In other words the
network has fewer links between its hubs than (7.14) would predict. These networks will
therefore become disassortative, a phenomenon we call structural disassortativity. This is
illustrated in Image 7.8a,b that show a simple scale-free network generated by the
configuration model. The network shows disassortative scaling, despite the fact that we did not
impose degree correlations during its construction.

Image 7.8
Natural and Structural Cutoffs
The ﬁgure illustrates the tension between the scale-free property and degree correlations. We show the
degree distribution (left panels) and the degree correlation function knn(k) (right panels) of a scale-free
network with N = 10,000 and γ = 2.5, generated by the conﬁguration model (Image 4.15).

  

(a,b) If we generate a scale-free network with the power-law degree distribution shown in (a), and we
forbid self-loops and multilinks, the network displays structural disassortativity, as indicated by knn(k) in
(b). In this case, we lack a sufﬁcient number of links between the high-degree nodes to maintain the
neutral nature of the network, hence for high k the knn(k) function must decay.

(c,d) We can eliminate structural disassortativity by relaxing the simple network requirement, i.e.
allowing multiple links between two nodes. As shown in (c,d), in this case we obtain a neutral scale-free
network.

(e,f) If we impose an upper cutoff by removing all nodes with k ≥ ks ≃ 100, as predicted by (7.15), the
network becomes neutral, as seen in (f).

We have two avenues to generate networks that are free of structural disassortativity:

•  We can relax the simple network requirement, allowing multiple links between the nodes.
The conflict disappears and the network will be neutral (Image 7.8c,d).
•  If we insist having a simple scale-free network that is neutral or assortative, we must remove
all hubs with degrees larger than ks. This is illustrated in Image 7.8e,f: a network that lacks
nodes with k ≥ 100 is neutral.

Finally, how can we decide whether the correlations observed in a particular network are a
consequence of structural disassortativity, or are generated by some unknown process that leads
to degree correlations? Degree-preserving randomization (Image 4.17) helps us distinguish
these two possibilities:

•  Degree Preserving Randomization with Simple Links (R-S)
We apply degree-preserving randomization to the original network and at each step we make
sure that we do not permit more than one link between a pair of nodes. On the algorithmic side
this means that each rewiring that generates multi-links is discarded. If the real knn(k) and the
R−S(k) are indistinguishable, then the correlations observed in a real system are

For a self-consistency check it is sometimes useful to perform degree-preserving

randomization that allows for multiple links between the nodes. On the algorithmic side this
means that we allow each random rewiring, even if it leads to multi-links. This process
eliminates all degree correlations.

We performed the randomizations discussed above for three real networks. As Image 7.9a
shows, the assortative nature of the scientific collaboration network disappears under both
randomizations. This indicates that the assortative correlations of the collaboration network is
not linked to its scale-free nature. In contrast, for the metabolic network the observed
disassortativity remains unchanged under R-S (Image 7.9c). Consequently the disassortativity of
the metabolic network is structural, being induced by its degree distribution.

In summary, the scale-free property can induce disassortativity in simple networks. Indeed, in
neutral or assortative networks we expect multiple links between the hubs. If multiple links are
forbidden (simple graph), the network will display disassortative tendencies. This conflict
vanishes for scale-free networks with γ ≥ 3 and for random networks. It also vanishes if we allow
multiple links between the nodes.

Section 7.5

Correlations in Real Networks

To understand the prevalence of degree correlations we need to inspect the correlations
characterizing real networks. In Image 7.10 we show the knn(k) function for the ten reference
networks, observing several patterns:

•  Power Grid
For the power grid knn(k) is flat and indistinguishable from its randomized version, indicating a
lack of degree correlations (Image 7.10a). Hence the power grid is neutral.
•  Internet
For small degrees (k ≤ 30) knn(k) shows a clear assortative trend, an effect that levels off for high
degrees (Image 7.10b). The degree correlations vanish in the randomized version of the Internet
map. Hence the Internet is assortative, but structural cutoffs eliminate the effect for high k.
•  Social Networks
The three networks capturing social interactions, the mobile phone network, the science
collaboration network and the actor network, all have an increasing knn(k), indicating that they
are assortative (Image 7.10c-e). Hence in these networks hubs tend to link to other hubs and
low-degree nodes tend to link to low-degree nodes. The fact that the observed knn(k) differs
R-S(k), indicates that the assortative nature of social networks is not due to their

This network displays a puzzling behavior: for k ≤ 20 the degree correlation function knn(k)
shows a clear assortative trend; for k > 20, however, we observe disassortative scaling (Image
7.10j). Such mixed behavior can emerge in networks that display extreme assortativity (Image

induces structural disassortativity, changing the slope of knn(k) for k ≫ ks.

Network Science

•  Of the ten reference networks the power grid is the only truly neutral network. Hence most
real networks display degree correlations.
•  All networks that display disassortative tendencies (email, protein, metabolic) do so thanks to
their scale-free property. Hence, these are all structurally disassortative. Only the WWW shows
disassortative correlations that are only partially explained by its degree distribution.
•  The degree correlations characterizing assortative networks are not explained by their degree
distribution. Most social networks (mobile phone calls, scientific collaboration, actor network)
are in this class and so is the Internet and the citation network

  

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed
assortativity. For example, the tendency of individuals to form communities, the topic of
CHAPTER 9, can induce assortative correlations [12]. Similarly, the society has endless
mechanisms, from professional committees to TV shows, to bring hubs together, enhancing the
assortative nature of social and professional networks. Finally, homophily, a well documented
social phenomena [13], indicates that individuals tend to associate with other individuals of
similar background and characteristics, hence individuals with comparable degree tend to know
each other. This degree-homophily may be responsible for the celebrity marriages as well
(Image 7.1).

Correlations in Directed Networks

correlations in directed networks we must take into account that each node i is

Generating Correlated Networks

To explore the impact of degree correlations on various network characteristics we must first
understand the correlations characterizing the network models discussed thus far. It is equally
important to develop algorithm that can generate networks with tunable correlations. As we
show in this section, given the conflict between the scale-free property and degree correlations,
this is not a trivial task.

Degree Correlations in Static Models

Erdős-Rényi Model
The random network model is neutral by definition. As it lacks hubs, it does not develop
structural correlations either. Hence for the Erdős-Rényi network knn(k) is given by (7.9),
predicting µ = 0 for any 〈k〉 and N.

Configuration Model
The configuration model (Image 4.15) is also neutral, independent of the choice of the degree
distribution pk. This is because the model allows for both multi-links and self-loops.
Consequently, any conflicts caused by the hubs are resolved by the multiple links between them.
If, however, we force the network to be simple, then the generated network will develop
structural disassortativity (Image 7.8).

i.e. the degree correlation function follows (7.10) with µ = − 1.

Taken together, the static models explored so far generate either neutral networks, or networks
characterized by structural disassortativity following (7.16).

Degree Correlations in Evolving Networks

To understand the emergence (or the absence) of degree correlations in growing networks, we
start with the initial attractiveness model (SECTION 6.5), which includes as a special case the
Barabási-Albert model

Initial Attractiveness Model
Consider a growing network in which preferential attachment follows (6.23), i.e. Π(k) ~ A + k,
where A is the initial attractiveness. Depending on the value of A, we observe three distinct
scaling regimes [15]:

•  Disassortative Regime: γ < 3

Hence the resulting network is disassortative, knn(k) decaying following the power-law [15, 16]

•  Neutral Regime: γ = 3
If A = 0 the initial attractiveness model reduces to the Barabási-Albert model. In this case
knn
Consequently knn(k) is independent of k, hence the network is neutral.
•  Weak Assortativity: γ > 3
If A > 0 the calculations predict
knn
As knn(k) increases logarithmically with k, the resulting network displays a weak assortative
tendency, but does not follow (7.10).

In summary, (7.17) - (7.20) indicate that the initial attractiveness model generates rather
complex degree correlations, from disassortativity to weak assortativity. Equation (7.19) also
shows that the network generated by the Barabási-Albert model is neutral. Finally, (7.17)

Tuning Degree Correlations

•  Step 2: Rewiring
Break the selected links and rewire them to form new pairs. Depending on the desired degree
correlations the rewiring is done in two ways:
• Step 2A: Assortative
By pairing the two highest degree nodes (a with b) and the two lowest degree nodes (c/ with d),
we connect nodes with comparable degrees, enhancing the network’s assortative nature.
•  Step 2B: Disassortative
By pairing the highest and the lowest degree nodes (a with d and b with c), we connect nodes
with different degrees, enhancing the network’s disassortative nature.

The Aij matrices (d) and (f) capture the inner regularity of networks with maximal correlations, consisting

to nodes with rather different degrees in (f).

By iterating these steps we gradually enhance the network’s assortative (Step 2A) or
disassortative (Step 2B) features. If we aim to generate a simple network (free of multi-links),
after Step 2 we check whether the particular rewiring leads to multi-links. If it does, we reject it,
returning to Step 1.

The correlations characterizing the networks generated by this algorithm converge to the
maximal (assortative) or minimal (disassortative) value that we can reach for the given degree
sequence (Image 7.13b). The model has no difficulty creating disassortative correlations (Image
7.13e,f). In the assortative limit simple networks display a mixed knn(k): assortative for small k
and disassortative for high k (Image 7.13b). This is a consequence of structural cutoffs: For
scale-free networks the system is unable to sustain assortativity for high k. The observed
behavior is reminiscent of the knn(k) function of citation networks (Image 7.10j).

The version of the Xalvi-Brunet & Sokolov algorithm introduced in Image 7.13 generates
maximally assortative or disassortative networks. We can tune the magnitude of the generated
degree correlations if we use the algorithm discussed in Image 7.14.

In summary, static models, like the configuration or hidden parameter model, are neutral if we
allow multi-links, and develop structural disassortativity if we force them to generate simple
networks. To generate networks with tunable correlations, we can use for example the Xalve-
Brunet & Sokolov algorithm. An important result of this section is (7.16) and (7.18), offering the
analytical form of the degree correlation function for the hidden paramenter model and for a
growing network, in both case predicting a power-law k-dependence. These results offer
analytical backing for the scaling hypothesis (7.10), indicating that both structural and

The Impact of Degree Correlations

As we have seen in Image 7.10, most real networks are characterized by some degree
correlations. Social networks are assortative; biological networks display structural
disassortativity. These correlations raise an important question: Why do we care? In other
words, do degree correlations alter the properties of a network? And which network properties
do they influence? This section addresses these important questions.

An important property of a random network is the emergence of a phase transition at 〈k〉 = 1,
marking the appearance of the giant component (SECTION 3.6). Image 7.15 shows the relative
size of the giant component for networks with different degree correlations, documenting
several patterns [8, 19, 20]:

•  Assortative Networks
For assortative networks the phase transition point moves to a lower 〈k〉, hence a giant
component emerges for 〈k〉 < 1. The reason is that it is easier to start a giant component if the
high-degree nodes seek out each other.
•  Disassortative Networks
The phase transition is delayed in disassortative networks, as in these the hubs tend to connect
to small degree nodes. Consequently, disassortative networks have difficulty forming a giant

For large 〈k〉 the giant component is smaller in assortative networks than in neutral or
disassortative networks. Indeed, assortativity forces the hubs to link to each other, hence they
fail to attract to the giant component the numerous small degree nodes.

Degree Correlations and the Phase Transition Point
Relative size of the giant component for an Erdős-Rényi network of size N=10,000 (green curve), which
is then rewired using the Xalvi-Brunet & Sokolov algorithm with p = 0.5 to induce degree correlations
(Image 7.14). The ﬁgure indicates that as we move from assortative to disassortative networks, the
phase transition point is delayed and the size of the giant component increases for large 〈k〉. Each point
represents an average over 10 independent runs.

These changes in the size and the structure of the giant component have implications to the
spread of diseases [22, 23, 24], the topic of CHAPTER 10. Indeed, as we have seen in Image 7.10,
social networks tend to be assortative. The high degree nodes therefore form a giant component
that acts as a “reservoir” for the disease, sustaining an epidemic even when on average the
network is not sufficiently dense for the virus to persist.

The altered giant component has implications for network robustness as well [25]. As we discuss
in CHAPTER 8, the removal of a network's hubs fragments a network. In assortative networks
hub removal makes less damage because the hubs form a core group, hence many of them are
redundant. Hub removal is more damaging in disassortative networks, as in these the hubs
connect to many small-degree nodes, which fall off the network once a hub is deleted.

Let us mention a few additional consequences of degree correlations:

•  Image 7.16 shows the path-length distribution of a random network rewired to display
different degree correlations. It indicates that in assortative networks the average path length is
shorter than in neutral networks. The most dramatic difference is in the network diameter,

•  Degree correlations influence a system’s stability against stimuli and perturbations [26] as
well as the synchronization of oscillators placed on a network [27, 28].
•  Degree correlations have a fundamental impact on the vertex cover problem [29], a much-
studied problem in graph theory that requires us to find the minimal set of nodes (cover) such
that each link is connected to at least one node in the cover (BOX 7.4).

Vertex Cover and Museum Guards

Imagine that you are the director of an open-air museum located in a large park. You wish
to place guards on the crossroads to observe each path. Yet, to save cost you want to use
as few guards as possible. How many guards do you need?

Let N be the number of crossroads and m < N is the number of guards you can afford to

The number of trials one needs to place the guards so that they cover all paths grows
exponentially with N. Indeed, this is one of the six basic NP-complete problems, called
the vertex cover problem. The vertex cover of a network is a set of nodes such that each link
is connected to at least one node of the set (Image 7.17). NP-completeness means that
there is no known algorithm which can identify a minimal vertex cover substantially
faster than using as exhaustive search, i.e. checking each possible configuration
individually. The number of nodes in the minimal a vertex cover depends on the network
topology, being affected by the degree distribution and degree correlations [29].

Summary

Degree correlations were first discovered in 2001 in the context of the Internet by Romualdo
Pastor-Satorras, Alexei Vazquez, and Alessandro Vespignani [4, 5], who also introduced the
degree correlation function knn(k) and the scaling (7.10). A year later Kim Sneppen and Sergey
Maslov used the full p(ki,kj), related to the eij matrix, to characterize the degree correlations of
protein interaction networks [32]. In 2003 Mark Newman introduced the degree correlation
coefficient [8, 9] together with the assortative, neutral, and disassortative distinction. These
terms have their roots in social sciences [13]:

Assortative mating reflects the tendency of individuals to date or marry individuals that are
similar to them. For example, low-income individuals marry low-income individuals and
college graduates marry college graduates. Network theory uses assortativity in the same spirit,
capturing the degree-based similarities between nodes: In assortative networks hubs tend to

properties link to each other (Image 7.18).

Disassortative mixing, when individuals link to individuals wo are unlike them, is also common in
some social and economic systems. Sexual networks are perhaps the best example, as most
sexual relationships are between individuals of different gender. In economic settings trade
typically takes place between individuals of different skills: the baker does not sell bread to
other bakers, and the shoemaker rarely fixes other shoemaker's shoes.

Taken together, there are several reasons why we care about degree correlations in networks
(BOX 7.5):

•  Degree correlations are present in most real networks (SECTION 7.5).
•  Once present, degree correlations change a network’s behavior (SECTION 7.7).
•  Degree correlations force us to move beyond the degree distribution, representing
quantifiable patters that govern the way nodes link to each other that are not captured by pk
alone.

Politics is Never Neutral

in sociology, meaning that nodes of similar characteristics tend to link to each other. In the map each
blue node corresponds to liberal blog and red nodes are conservative. Blue links connect liberal blogs,
red links connect conservative blogs, yellow links go from liberal to conservative, and purple from
conservative to liberal. As the image indicates, very few blogs link across the political divide,

Despite the considerable effort devoted to characterizing degree correlations, our understanding
Network Science
  
of the phenomena remains incomplete. For example, while in SECTION 7.6 we offered an
by Albert-László Barabási
algorithm to tune degree correlations, the problem is far from being fully resolved. Indeed, the
most accurate description of a network's degree correlations is contained in the eij matrix.
Generating networks with an arbitrary eij remains a difficult task.

Finally, in this chapter we focused on the knn(k) function, which captures two-point
correlations. In principle higher order correlations are also present in some networks (BOX 7.6).
The impact of such three or four point correlations remains to be understood.

Box 7.6

Two-Point, Three-Point Correlations

The complete degree correlations characterizing a network are determined by the
conditional probability P(k(1), k(2), ..., k(k)|k) that a node with degree k connects to nodes
with degrees k(1), k(2), ..., k(k).

Two-point Correlations
The simplest of these is the two-point correlation discussed in this chapter, being the
conditional probability P(k’|k) that a node with degree k is connected to a node with
degree k′. For uncorrelated networks this conditional probability is independent of k, i.e.
P(k’| k) = k’pk’ / 〈k〉 [18]. As the empirical evaluation of P(k′|k) in real networks is
cumbersome, it is more practical to analyze the degree correlation function knn(k) defined
in (7.7).

Three-point Correlations
Correlations involving three nodes are determined by P(k(1),k(2)|k). This conditional
probability is connected to the clustering coefficient. Indeed, the average clustering
coefficient C(k) [22, 23] can be formally written as the probability that a degree-k node is
connected to nodes with degrees k(1) and k(2), and that those two are joined by a link,
averaged over all the possible values of k(1) and k(2)

Section 7.10

Advanced Topic 7.A
Degree Correlation Coefficient

In BOX 7.2 we defined the degree correlation coefficient r as an alternative measure of degree
correlations [8, 9]. The use of a single number to characterize degree correlations is attractive,
as it offers a way to compare the correlations observed in networks of different nature and size.
Yet, to effectively use r we must be aware of its origin.

The hypothesis behind the correlation coefficient r implies that the knn(k) function can be
approximated by the linear function

(k) ∼ rk

knn
This is different from the scaling (7.10), which assumes a power law dependence on k. Equation
(7.21) raises several issues:

(7. 21)

• The initial attractiveness model predicts a power law (7.18) or a logarithmic k-dependence
(7.20) for the degree correlation function. A similar power law is derived in (7.16) for the hidden
parameter model. Consequently, r forces a linear fit to an inherently nonlinear function. This
linear dependence is not supported by numerical simulations or analytical calculations. Indeed,
as we show in Image 7.19, (7.21) offers a poor fit to the data for both assortative and
disassortative networks.
• As we have seen in Image 7.10, the dependence of knn(k) on k is complex, often changing
trends for large k thanks to the structural cutoff. A linear fit ignores this inherent complexity.
• The maximally correlated model has a vanishing r for large N, despitethe fact that the network
maintains its degree correlations (BOX 7.7).This suggests that the degree correlation coefficient
has difficulty detectingcorrelations characterizing large networks.

Relationship Between μ and r
On the positive side, r and µ are not independent of each other. To show this we calculated r and
µ for the ten reference networks (TABLE 7.1). The results are plotted in Image 7.20, indicating
that µ and r correlate for positive r. Note, however, that this correlation breaks down for
negative r. To understand the origin of this behavior, next we derive a direct relationship
between µ and r. To be specific we assume the validity of (7.10) and determine the value of r for a
network with correlation exponent µ.

We start by determining a from (7.10). We can write the second moment of the degree
distribution as

For µ = 0 the term in the last parenthesis vanishes, obtaining r = 0. Hence if µ = 0 (neutral
network), the network will be neutral based on r as well. For k > 1 (7.22) suggests that for µ > 0
the parenthesis is positive, hence r > 0, and for µ < 0 the parenthesis is negative, hence r < 0.
Therefore r and µ predict degree correlations of similar kind.

In summary, the degree correlation coefficient assumes that knn(k) scales linearly with k, a

networks degree pairs for which rkk’ > 1 cannot exist. Yet, for some networks and for some k, k’
pairs rkk’ is larger than one. This is clearly non-physical and signals some conflict in the

For scale-free networks these conditions are fulfilled in the region k, k’ > (aN)1/(γ+1), where a is a

scaling provides a lower bound for the structural cutoff, in the sense that whenever the cutoff of

Introduction

Errors and failures can corrupt all human designs: The failure of a component in your car’s
engine may force you to call for a tow truck or a wiring error in your computer chip can make
your computer useless. Many natural and social systems have, however, a remarkable ability to
sustain their basic functions even when some of their components fail. Indeed, while there are
countless protein misfolding errors and missed reactions in our cells, we rarely notice their
consequences. Similarly, large organizations can function despite numerous absent employees.
Understanding the origins of this robustness is important for many disciplines:

•  Robustness is a central question in biology and medicine, helping us understand why some
mutations lead to diseases and others do not.
•  It is of concern for social scientists and economists, who explore the stability of human
societies and institutions in the face of such disrupting forces as famine, war, and changes in
social and economic order.
•  It is a key issue for ecologists and environmental scientists, who seek to predict the failure of
an ecosystem when faced with the disruptive effects of human activity.
•  It is the ultimate goal in engineering, aiming to design communication systems, cars, or
airplanes that can carry out their basic functions despite occasional component failures.

Networks play a key role in the robustness of biological, social and technological systems.
Indeed, a cell's robustness is encoded in intricate regulatory, signaling and metabolic networks;
the society’s resilience cannot be divorced from the interwoven social, professional, and
communication web behind it; an ecosystem’s survivability cannot be understood without a
careful analysis of the food web that sustains each species. Whenever nature seeks robustness,
it resorts to networks.

The purpose of this chapter is to understand the role networks play in ensuring the robustness
of a complex system. We show that the structure of the underlying network plays an essential
role in a system’s ability to survive random failures or deliberate attacks. We explore the role of
networks in the emergence of cascading failures, a damaging phenomenon frequently
encountered in real systems. Most important, we show that the laws governing the error and
attack tolerance of complex networks and the emergence of cascading failures, are universal.
Hence uncovering them helps us understand the robustness of a wide range of complex
systems.

Percolation Theory

The removal of a single node has only limited impact on a network’s integrity (Image 8.3a). The
removal of several nodes, however, can break a network into several isolated components
(Image 8.3d). Obviously, the more nodes we remove, the higher are the chances that we damage
a network, prompting us to ask: How many nodes do we have to delete to fragment a network

Percolation

Percolation theory is a highly developed subfield of statistical physics and mathematics [2, 3, 4,
5]. A typical problem addressed by it is illustrated in Image 8.4a,b, showing a square lattice,
where we place pebbles with probability p at each intersection. Neighboring pebbles are
considered connected, forming clusters of size two or more. Given that the position of each
pebble is decided by chance, we ask:

• What is the expected size of the largest cluster?
• What is the average cluster size?

Obviously, the higher is p, the larger are the clusters. A key prediction of percolation theory is
that the cluster size does not change gradually with p. Rather, for a wide range of p the lattice is
populated with numerous tiny clusters (Image 8.4a). If p approaches a critical value pc, these
small clusters grow and coalesce, leading to the emergence of a large cluster at pc. We call this
the percolating cluster as it reaches the end of the lattice. In other words, at pc we observe a phase
transition from many small clusters to a percolating cluster that percolates the whole lattice
(Image 8.4b).

To quantify the nature of this phase transition, we focus on three quantities:

pc)βp

(8. 1)

pc|−γp

•  Average Cluster Size: 〈d〉
According to percolation theory the average size of all finite clusters follows
⟨s⟩ ∼ |p −
In other words, the average cluster size diverges as we approach pc (Image 8.4c).
•  Order Parameter: P∞
The probability P∞∞ that a randomly chosen pebble belongs to the largest cluster follows
p∞
Therefore as p decreases towards pc the probability that a pebble belongs to the largest cluster
drops zero (Image 8.4d).
•  Correlation Length: ξ
The mean distance between two pebbles that belong to the same cluster follows
ξ ∼ |p −
Therefore while for p < pc the distance between the pebbles in the same cluster is finite, at pc
this distance diverges. This means that at pc the size of the largest cluster becomes infinite,
allowing it to percolate the whole lattice.

•  For large p most (but not all) pebbles belong to a single cluster, colored purple. This is called the
percolating cluster, as it spans the whole lattice (see also Image 8.6).
•  The average cluster size, 〈s〉, in function of p. As we approach pc from below, numerous small clusters
coalesce and 〈s〉 diverges, following (8.1). The same divergence is observed above pc, where to
calculate 〈s〉 we remove the percolating cluster from the average. The same exponent γp characterizes

The exponents γp, βp, and ν are called critical exponents, as they characterize the system’s
Network Science
behavior near the critical point pc. Percolation theory predicts that these exponents are
by Albert-László Barabási
universal, meaning that they are independent of the nature of the lattice or the precise value of
pc. Therefore, whether we place the pebbles on a triangular or a hexagonal lattice, the behavior
of 〈s〉, P∞, and ξ is characterized by the same γp, βp, and ν exponents.

  

Consider the following examples to better understand this universality:

•  The value of pc depends on the lattice type, hence it is not universal. For example, for a two-
dimensional square lattice (Image 8.4) we have pc ≈ 0.593, while for a two-dimensional
triangular lattice pc = 1/2 (site percolation).
•  The value of pc also changes with the lattice dimension: for a square lattice pc ≈ 0.593 (v = 2);
for a simple cubic lattice (d = 3) pc ≈ 0.3116. Therefore in d = 3 we need to cover a smaller fraction
of the nodes with pebbles to reach the percolation transition.
•  In contrast with pc, the critical exponents do not depend on the lattice type, but only on the
lattice dimension. In two dimensions, the case shown in Image 8.4, we have γp = 43/18, βp = 5/36,
and ν = 4/3, for any lattice. In three dimensions γp = 1.80, βp = 0.41, and ν = 0.88. For any d > 6 we
have γp = 1, βp = 1, ν = 1/2, hence for large d the exponents are independent of d as well [2]

Inverse Percolation Transition and Robustness

The phenomena of primary interest in robustness is the impact of node failures on the integrity
of a network. We can use percolation theory to describe this process.

Let us view a square lattice as a network whose nodes are the intersections (Image 8.5). We
randomly remove an f fraction of nodes, asking how their absence impacts the integrity of the
lattice.

If f is small, the missing nodes do little damage to the network. Increasing f, however, can
isolate chunks of nodes from the giant component. Finally, for sufficiently large f the giant
component breaks into tiny disconnected components (Image 8.5).

This fragmentation process is not gradual, but it is characterized by a critical threshold fc: For
any f < fc we continue to have a giant component. Once f exceeds fc, the giant component
vanishes. This is illustrated by the f-dependence of P∞, representing the probability that a node
is part of the giant component (Image 8.5): P∞ is nonzero under fc, but it drops to zero as we
approach fc. The critical exponents characterizing this breakdown, γp, βp, ν, are the same as
those encountered in (8.1)-(8.3). Indeed, the two processes can be mapped into each other by
choosing f = 1 − p.

probability that a randomly selected node belongs to the largest component. The observed networks are

shown on the bottom panels. Under each panel we list the characteristics of the corresponding phases.

What, however, if the underlying network is not as regular as a square lattice? As we will see in
the coming sections, the answer depends on the precise network topology. Yet, for random
networks the answer continues to be provided by percolation theory: Random networks under
random node failures share the same scaling exponents as infinite-dimensional percolation.
Hence the critical exponents for a random network are γp = 1, βp = 1 and ν = 1/2, corresponding to
the d > 6 percolation exponents encountered earlier. The critical exponents for a scale-free
network are provided in ADVANCED TOPICS 8.A.

In summary, the breakdown of a network under random node removal is not a gradual process.
Rather, removing a small fraction of nodes has only limited impact on a network’s integrity. But
once the fraction of removed nodes reaches a critical threshold, the network abruptly breaks
into disconnected components. In other words, random node failures induce a phase transition
from a connected to a fragmented network. We can use the tools of percolation theory to
characterize this transition in both regular and in random networks. For scale-free networks
key aspects of the described phenomena change, however, as we discuss in the next section.

Box 8.1

From Forest Fires to Percolation Theory

We can use the spread of a fire in a forest to illustrate the basic concepts of percolation
theory. Let us assume that each pebble in Image 8.4a,b is a tree and that the lattice
describes a forest. If a tree catches fire, it ignites the neighboring trees; these, in turn
ignite their neighbors. The fire continues to spread until no burning tree has a non-
burning neighbor. We must therefore ask: If we randomly ignite a tree, what fraction of
the forest burns down? And how long it takes the fire to burn out?

The answer depends on the tree density, controlled by the parameter p. For small p the
forest consists of many small islands of trees (p = 0.55, Image 8.6a), hence igniting any
tree will at most burn down one of these small islands. Consequently, the fire will die out
quickly. For large p most trees belong to a single large cluster, hence the fire rapidly
sweeps through the dense forest (p = 0.62, Image 8.6c).

The simulations indicate that there is a critical pc at which it takes extremely long time for
the fire to end. This pc is the critical threshold of the percolation problem. Indeed, at p = pc
the giant component just emerges through the union of many small clusters (Image 8.6b).
Hence the fire has to follow a long winding path to reach all trees in the loosely connected

the pebbles are trees, any ﬁre can at most consume only a small fraction of the trees, burning out
quickly. Once p reaches pc≈0.593, shown on (b), the largest cluster percolates the whole lattice
and the ﬁre can reach many trees, burning slowly through the forest. Increasing p beyond pc
connects more pebbles (trees) to the largest component, as seen for p = 0.62 on (c). Hence, the

Robustness of Scale-free Networks

removed nodes reaches a critical value fc, the Internet should fragment into many isolated
subgraphs (Image 8.5). The simulations indicate otherwise: The Internet refuses to break apart
even under rather extensive node failures. Instead the size of the largest component decreases
gradually, vanishing only in the vicinity of f = 1 (Image 8.7a). This means that the network
behind the Internet shows an unusual robustness to random node failures: we must remove all
of its nodes to destroy its giant component. This conclusion disagrees with percolation on
lattices, which predicts that a network must fall apart after the removal of a finite fraction of its
nodes.

Robustness of Scale-free Networks
• The fraction of Internet routers that belong to the giant component after an f fraction of routers are
randomly removed. The ratio P∞( f)/P∞(0) provides the relative size of the giant component. The
simulations use the router level Internet topology of Table 4.1.
• The fraction of nodes that belong to the giant component after an f fraction of nodes are removed from
a scale-free network with γ = 2.5, N = 10,000 and kmin = 1.

The plots indicate that the Internet and in general a scale-free network do not fall apart after the removal
of a ﬁnite fraction of nodes. We need to remove almost all nodes (i.e. fc=1) to fragment these networks.

The behavior observed above is not unique to the Internet. To show this we repeated the above
measurement for a scale-free network with degree exponent γ = 2.5, observing an identical
pattern (Image 8.7b): Under random node removal the giant component fails to collapse at some
finite fc, but vanishes only gradually near f = 1 (Video 8.1). This hints that the Internet's observed
robustness is rooted in its scale-free topology. The goal of this section is to uncover and
quantify the origin of this remarkable robustness.

Molloy-Reed Criterion

To understand the origin of the anomalously high fc characterizing the Internet and scale-free
networks, we calculate fc for a network with an arbitrary degree distribution. To do so we rely on
a simple observation: For a network to have a giant component, most nodes that belong to it
must be connected to at least two other nodes (Image 8.8). This leads to the Molloy-Reed criterion

Critical Threshold

To understand the mathematical origin of the robustness observed in Image 8.7, we ask at what
threshold will a scale-free network loose its giant component. By applying the Molloy-Reed

Robustness and Degree Exponent
The probability that a node belongs to the giant component after the removal of an f fraction of nodes
from a scale-free network with degree exponent γ. For γ = 4 we observe a ﬁnite critical point fc≃2/3, as
predicted by (8.9). For γ < 3, however, fc → 1. The networks were generated with the conﬁguration
model using kmin = 2 and N = 10, 000.

To better understand this result we express 〈k〉 and 〈k2〉in terms of the parameters characterizing
a scale-free network: the degree exponent γ and the minimal and maximal degrees, kmin and
kmax, obtaining

•  For γ < 3 the kmax diverges for large N, following (4.18). Therefore in the N → ∞ limit (8.9)
predicts fc → 1. In other words, to fragment an infinite scale-free network we must remove all of
its nodes.

Equations (8.6)-(8.9) are the key results of this chapter, predicting that scale-free networks can
withstand an arbitrary level of random failures without breaking apart. The hubs are responsible
for this remarkable robustness. Indeed, random node failures by definition are blind to degree,
affecting with the same probability a small or a large degree node. Yet, in a scale-free network
we have far more small degree nodes than hubs. Therefore, random node removal will
predominantly remove one of the numerous small nodes as the chances of selecting randomly
one of the few large hubs is negligible. These small nodes contribute little to a network’s
integrity, hence their removal does little damage.

Returning to the airport analogy of Image 4.6, if we close a randomly selected airport, we will
most likely shut down one of the numerous small airports. Its absence will be hardly noticed
elsewhere in the world: you can still travel from New York to Tokyo, or from Los Angeles to Rio
de Janeiro.

Robustness of Finite Networks

Equation (8.9) predicts that for a scale-free network fc converges to one only if kmax → ∞, which
corresponds to the N → ∞ limit. While many networks of practical interest are very large, they
are still finite, prompting us to ask if the observed anomaly is relevant for finite networks. To
address this we insert (4.18) into (8.9), obtaining that fc depends on the network size N as

where C collects all terms that do not depend on N. Equation (8.10) indicates that the larger a
network, the closer is its critical threshold to fc = 1.

To see how close fc can get to the theoretical limit fc = 1, we calculate fc for the Internet. The
router level map of the Internet has 〈k2〉/〈k〉 = 37.91 (Table 4.1). Inserting this ratio into (8.7) we
obtain fc = 0.972. Therefore, we need to remove 97% of the routers to fragment the Internet into
disconnected components. The probability that by chance 186,861 routers fail simultaneously,
representing 97% of the N = 192,244 routers on the Internet, is effectively zero. This is the
reason why the topology of the Internet is so robust to random failures.

Robustness and Link Removal
by Albert-László Barabási
What happens if we randomly remove the links rather than the nodes? The calculations predict that the
critical threshold fc is the same for random link and node removal [7, 8]. To illustrate this, we compare
the impact of random node and link removal on a random network with 〈k〉 = 2. The plot indicates that
the network falls apart at the same critical threshold fc ≃ 0.5. The difference is in the shape of the two
curves. Indeed, the removal of an f fraction of nodes leaves us with a smaller giant component than the
removal of an f fraction of links. This is not unexpected: on average each node removes 〈k〉 links. Hence
the removal of an f fraction of nodes is equivalent with the removal of an f〈k〉 fraction of links, which
clearly makes more damage than the removal of an f fraction of links.

  

In summary, in this section we encountered a fundamental property of real networks: their
robustness to random failures. Equation (8.7) predicts that the breakdown threshold of a
network depends on 〈k〉 and 〈k2〉, which in turn are uniquely determined by the network's degree
distribution. Therefore random networks have a finite threshold, but for scale-free networks
with γ < 3 the breakdown threshold converges to one. In other words, we need to remove all
nodes to break a scale-free network apart, indicating that these networks show an extreme
robustness to random failures.

The origin of this extreme robustness is the large 〈k2〉 term. Given that for most real networks
〈k2〉 is larger than the random expectation, enhanced robustness is a generic property of many
networks. This robustness is rooted in the fact that random failures affect mainly the numerous
small nodes, which play only a limited role in maintaning a network’s integrity.

consequence of the fact that its degree distribution is exponential (Image 8.31a), and the actor

(8.7).

Section 8.4

Attack Tolerance

The important role the hubs play in holding together a scale-free network motivates our next
question: What if we do not remove the nodes randomly, but go after the hubs? That is, we first
remove the highest degree node, followed by the node with the next highest degree and so on.
The likelihood that nodes would break in this particular order under normal conditions is
essentially zero. Instead this process mimics an attack on the network, as it assumes a detailed
knowledge of the network topology, an ability to target the hubs, and a desire to deliberately
cripple the network [1].

The removal of a single hub is unlikely to fragment a network, as the remaining hubs can still
hold the network together. After the removal of a few hubs, however, large chunks of nodes
start falling off (Video 8.2). If the attack continues, it can rapidly break the network into tiny
clusters.

The impact of hub removal is quite evident in the case of a scale-free network (Image 8.11): the
critical point, which is absent under random failures, reemerges under attacks. Not only
reemerges, but it has a remarkably low value. Therefore the removal of a small fraction of the
hubs is sufficient to break a scale-free network into tiny clusters. The goal of this section is to

Scale-free Network Under Attack
The probability that a node belongs to the largest connected component in a scale-free network under
attack (purple) and under random failures (green). For an attack we remove the nodes in a decreasing
order of their degree: we start with the biggest hub, followed by the next biggest and so on. In the case
of failures the order in which we choose the nodes is random, independent of the node’s degree. The
plot illustrates a scale-free network’s extreme fragility to attacks: fc is small, implying that the removal of
only a few hubs can disintegrate the network. The initial network has degree exponent γ = 2.5, kmin = 2
and N = 10,000.

Critical Threshold Under Attack

An attack on a scale-free network has two consequences (Image 8.11):

• The critical threshold fc is smaller than fc = 1, indicating that under attacks a scale-free
network can be fragmented by the removal of a finite fraction of its hubs.

To quantify this process we need to analytically calculate fc for a network under attack. To do this
we rely on the fact that hub removal changes the network in two ways [9]:

•  It changes the maximum degree of the network from kmax to k'max as all nodes with degree
larger than k'max have been removed.
•  The degree distribution of the network changes from pk to p'k', as nodes connected to the
removed hubs will loose links, altering the degrees of the remaining nodes.

Scale-free Networks Under Attack
During an attack we aim to inﬂict maximum damage on a network. We can do this by removing ﬁrst the
highest degree node, followed by the next highest degree, and so on. As the movie illustrates, it is
sufﬁcient to remove only a few hubs to break a scale-free network into disconnected components.
Compare this with the network’s refusal to break apart under random node failures, shown in Video 8.1.

Image 8.12 shows the numerical solution of (8.12) in function of the degree exponent γ, allowing
us to draw several conclusions:

•  While fc for failures decreases monotonically with γ, fc for attacks can have a non-monotonic
behavior: it increases for small γ and decreases for large γ.
•  fc for attacks is always smaller than fc for random failures.
•  For large γ a scale-free network behaves like a random network. As a random network lacks
hubs, the impact of an attack is similar to the impact of random node removal. Consequently
the failure and the attack thresholds converge to each other for large γ. Indeed, if γ → ∞ then pk
→ δ(k − kmin), meaning that all nodes have the same degree kmin. Therefore random failures and
targeted attacks become indistinguishable in the γ → ∞ limit, obtaining

The dependence of the breakdown threshold, fc, on the degree exponent γ for scale-free networks with

The airport analogy helps us understand the fragility of scale-free networks to attacks: The
closing of two large airports, like Chicago’s O’Hare Airport or the Atlanta International Airport,
for only a few hours would be headline news, altering travel throughout the U.S. Should some
series of events lead to the simultaneous closure of the Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, and New York
airports, the biggest hubs, air travel within the North American continent would come to a halt
within hours.

In summary, while random node failures do not fragment a scale-free network, an attack that
targets the hubs can easily destroy such a network. This fragility is bad news for the Internet, as
it indicates that it is inherently vulnerable to deliberate attacks. It can be good news in
medicine, as the vulnerability of bacteria to the removal of their hub proteins offers avenues to
design drugs that kill unwanted bacteria.

Paul Baran and the Internet

In 1959 RAND, a Californian think-tank, has assigned Paul Baran, a young engineer at
that time, to develop a communication system that can survive a Soviet nuclear attack. As
a nuclear strike handicaps all equipment within the range of the detonation, Baran had to
design a system whose users outside this range do not loose contact with one another. He
described the communication network of his time as a “hierarchical structure of a set of
stars connected in the form of a larger star,” offering an early description of what we call
today a scale-free network [11]. He concluded that this topology is too centralized to be

noting that the “centralized network is obviously vulnerable as destruction of a single
central node destroys communication between the end stations.”

Baran decided that the ideal survivable architecture was a distributed mesh-like network
(Image 8.14c). This network is sufficiently redundant, so that even if some of its nodes
fail, alternative paths can connect the remaining nodes. Baran’s ideas were ignored by the
military, so when the Internet was born a decade later, it relied on distributed protocols
that allowed each node to decide where to link. This decentralized philosophy paved the
way to the emergence of a scale-free Internet, rather than the uniform mesh-like
topology envisioned by Baran.

of a network fail independently of each other. In reality, in a network the activity of each node
Network Science
depends on the activity of its neighboring nodes. Consequently the failure of a node can induce
by Albert-László Barabási
the failure of the nodes connected to it. Let us consider a few examples:

  

•  Blackouts (Power Grid)
After the failure of a node or a link the electric currents are instantaneously reorganized on the
rest of the power grid. For example, on August 10, 1996, a hot day in Oregon, a line carrying 1,300
megawatts sagged close to a tree and snapped. Because electricity cannot be stored, the current
it carried was automatically shifted to two lower voltage lines. As these were not designed to
carry the excess current, they too failed. Seconds later the excess current lead to the
malfunction of thirteen generators, eventually causing a blackout in eleven U.S. states and two
Canadian provinces [12].
•  Denial of Service Attacks (Internet)
If a router fails to transmit the packets received by it, the Internet protocols will alert the
neighboring routers to avoid the troubled equipment by re-routing the packets using alternative
routes. Consequently a failed router increases traffic on other routers, potentially inducing a
series of denial of service attacks throughout the Internet [13].
•  Financial Crises
Cascading failures are common in economic systems. For example, the drop in the house prices
in 2008 in the U.S. has spread along the links of the financial network, inducing a cascade of
failed banks, companies and even nations [14, 15, 16]. It eventually caused the worst global
financial meltdown since the 1930s Great Depression.

Image 8.15
Domino Effect
The domino effect is the fall of a series of dominos induced by the fall of the ﬁrst domino. The term is
often used to refer to a sequence of events induced by a local change, that propagates through the
whole system. Hence the domino effect represents perhaps the simplest illustration of cascading
failures, the topic of this section.

did not stay localized, but it spread along the links of the network, inducing additional failures.
Eventually, multiple nodes lost their ability to carry out their normal functions. Consequently
each of these systems experienced cascading failures, a dangerous phenomena in most networks
[17]. In this section we discuss the empirical patterns governing such cascading failures. The
modeling of these events is the topic of the next section.

•  Blackouts
A blackout can be caused by power station failures, damage to electric transmission lines, a
short circuit, and so on. When the operating limits of a component is exceeded, it is
automatically disconnected to protect it. Such failure redistributes the power previously carried
by the failed component to other components, altering the power flow, the frequency, the
voltage and the phase of the current, and the operation of the control, monitoring and alarm
systems. These changes can in turn disconnect other components as well, starting an avalanche
of failures.

A frequently recorded measure of blackout size is the energy unserved. Image 8.17a shows the
probability distribution p(s) of energy unserved in all North American blackouts between 1984
and 1998. Electrical engineers approximate the obtained distribution with the power law [18],

s−α

(8. 14)

p(s) ∼
where the avalanche exponent α is listed in Table 8. 2 for several countries. The power law nature
of this distribution indicates that most blackouts are rather small, affecting only a few
consumers. These coexists, however, with occasional major blackouts, when millions of
consumers lose power (Image 8.16).

•  Information Cascades
Modern communication systems, from email to Facebook or Twitter, facilitate the cascade-like
spreading of information along the links of the social network. As the events pertaining to the
spreading process often leave digital traces, these platforms allow researchers to detect the
underlying cascades.

The micro-blogging service Twitter has been particularly studied in this context. On Twitter the
network of who follows whom can be reconstructed by crawling the service's follower graph. As
users frequently share web-content using URL shorteners, one can also track each
spreading/sharing process. A study tracking 74 million such events over two months followed
the diffusion of each URL from a particular seed node through its reposts until the end of a
cascade (Image 8.18). As Figure 8.17b indicates, the size distribution of the observed cascades
follows the power-law (8.14) with an avalanche exponent α ≈ 1.75 [19]. The power law indicates
that the vast majority of posted URLs do not spread at all, a conclusion supported by the fact
that the average cascade size is only 〈s〉 = 1.14. Yet, a small fraction of URLs are reposted
thousands of times.

observed seismic waves. After [20].

Each year around 500,000 earthquakes are detected with instrumentation. Only about 100,000
of these are sufficiently strong to be felt by humans. Seismologists approximate the distribution
of earthquak amplitudes with the power law (8.14) with α ≈ 1.67 (Image 8.17c) [20].

The power-law distribution (8.14) followed by blackouts, information cascades and earthquakes
indicates that most cascading failures are relatively small. These small cascades capture the loss
of electricity in a few houses, tweets of little interest to most users, or earthquakes so small that
one needs sensitive instruments to detect them. Equation (8.14) predicts that these numerous
small events coexist with a few exceptionally large events. Examples of such major cascades
include the 2003 power outage in North America (Image 8.16), the tweet Iran Election Crisis: 10
Incredible YouTube Videos http://bit.ly/vPDLo that was shared 1,399 times [21], or the January 2010
earthquake in Haiti, with over 200,000 victims. Interestingly, the avalanche exponents reported
by electrical engineers, media researches and seismologists are surprisingly close to each other,
being between 1.6 and 2 (Table 8.2).

Cascading failures are documented in many other environments:

•  The consequences of bad weather or mechanical failures can cascade through airline
schedules, delaying multiple flights and stranding thousands of passengers (BOX 8.3) [22].
•  The disappearance of a species can cascade through the food web of an ecosystem, inducing
the extinction of numerous species and altering the habitat of others [23, 24, 25, 26].
•  The shortage of a particular component can cripple supply chains. For example, the 2011
floods in Thailand have resulted in a chronic shortage of car components that disrupted the
production chain of more than 1,000 automotive factories worldwide. Therefore the damage was
not limited to the flooded factories, but resulted in worldwide insurance claims reaching $20
billion [27].

Information Cascades
Examples of information cascades on Twitter. Nodes denote Twitter accounts, the top node
corresponding to the account that ﬁrst posted a certain shortened URL. The links correspond to those
who retweeted it. These cascades capture the heterogeneity of information avalanches: most URLs are
not retweeted at all, appearing as single nodes in the ﬁgure. Some, however, start major retweet
avalanches, like the one seen at the bottom panel. After [19].

In summary, cascading effects are observed in systems of rather different nature. Their size
distribution is well approximated with the power law (8.14), implying that most cascades are too
small to be noticed; a few, however, are huge, having a global impact. The goal of the next
section is to understand the origin of these phenomena and to build models that can reproduce
its salient features.

Cascading Flight Congestions

Flight delays in the U.S. have an economic impact of over $40 billion per year [28], caused
by the need for enhanced operations, passenger loss of time, decreased productivity and
missed business and leisure opportunities. A flight delay is the time difference between
the expected and actual departure/arrival times of a flight. Airline schedules include a
buffer period between consecutive flights to accommodate short delays. When a delay
exceeds this buffer, subsequent flights that use the same aircraft, crew or gate, are also
delayed. Consequently a delay can propagate in a cascade-like fashion through the airline
network.

While most flights in 2010 were on time, 37.5% arrived or departed late [22]. The delay
distribution follows (8.14), implying that while most flights were delayed by just a few
minutes, a few were hours behind schedule. These long delays induce correlated delay
patterns, a signature of cascading congestions in the air transportation system (Image
8.19).

Modeling Cascading Failures

The emergence of a cascading event depends on many variables, from the structure of the
network on which the cascade propagates, to the nature of the propagation process and the
breakdown criteria of each individual component. The empirical results indicate that despite the
diversity of these variables, the size distribution of the observed avalanches is universal, being
independent of the particularities of the system. The purpose of this section is to understand
the mechanisms governing cascading phenomena and to explain the power-law nature of the
avalanche size distribution.

Numerous models have been proposed to capture the dynamics of cascading events [18, 29, 30,
31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. While these models differ in the degree of fidelity they employ to capture
specific phenomena, they indicate that systems that develop cascades share three key
ingredients:

•  Each component has a local breakdown rule that determines when it contributes to a cascade,

(Twitter).
•  Each system has a mechanism to redistribute the traffic to other nodes upon the failure or the
activation of a component.

Next, we discuss two models that predict the characteristics of cascading failures at different
levels of abstraction.

Failure Propagation Model

Introduced to model the spread of ideas and opinions [30], the failure propagation model is
frequently used to describe cascading failures as well [35]. The model is defined as follows:

Consider a network with an arbitrary degree distribution, where each node contains an agent.
An agent i can be in the state 0 (active or healthy) or 1 (inactive or failed), and is characterized by a
breakdown threshold φi = φ for all i.

All agents are initially in the healthy state 0. At time t = 0 one agent switches to state 1,
corresponding to an initial component failure or to the release of a new piece of information. In
each subsequent time step we randomly pick an agent and update its state following a threshold
rule:

•  If the selected agent i is in state 0, it inspects the state of its ki neighbors. The agent i adopts
state 1 (i.e. it also fails) if at least a φ fraction of its ki neighbors are in state 1, otherwise it
retains its original state 0.
•  If the selected agent i is in state 1, it does not change its state.

Failure Propagation Model
(a,b) The development of a cascade in a small network in which each node has the same breakdown
threshold φ = 0.4. Initially all nodes are in state 0, shown as green circles. After node A changes its state
to 1 (purple), its neighbors B and E will have a fraction f = 1/2 > 0.4 of their neighbors in state 1.
Consequently they also fail, changing their state to 1, as shown in (b). In the next time step C and D will
also fail, as both have f > 0.4. Consequently the cascade sweeps the whole network, reaching a size s =
5. One can check that if we initially ﬂip node B, it will not induce an avalanche.

exponent α = 3/2 . In the supercritical regime we have only a few small avalanches, as most cascades
are global. In the upper critical and subcritical regime we see only small avalanches. After [30].

In other words, a healthy node i changes its state if a φ fraction of its neighbors have failed.
Network Science
Depending on the local network topology, an initial perturbation can die out immediately,
by Albert-László Barabási
failing to induce the failure of any other node. It can also lead to the failure of multiple nodes, as
illustrated in a Image 8.20a,b. The simulations document three regimes with distinct avalanche
characteristics (Figure 8.20c):

  

•  Subcritical Regime
If 〈k〉 is high, changing the state of a node is unlikely to move other nodes over their threshold,
as the healthy nodes have many healthy neighbors. In this regime cascades die out quickly and
their sizes follow an exponential distribution. Hence the system is unable to support large global
cascades (blue symbols, Image 8.20c,d).
•  Supercritical Regime
If 〈k〉 is small, flipping a single node can put several of its neighbors over the threshold,
triggering a global cascade. In this regime perturbations induce major breakdowns (purple
symbols, Image 8.20c,d).
•  Critical Regime
At the boundary of the subcritical and supercritical regime the avalanches have widely different
sizes. Numerical simulations indicate that in this regime the avalanche sizes s follow (8.14)
(green and orange symbols, Image 8.21d) with α = 3/2 if the underlying network is random.

Branching Model

Given the complexity of the failure propogation model, it is hard to analytically predict the
scaling behavior of the obtained avalanches. To understand the power-law nature of p(s) and to
calculate the avalanche exponent α, we turn to the branching model. This is the simplest model
that still captures the basic features of a cascading event.

The model builds on the observation that each cascading failure follows a branching process.
Indeed, let us call the node whose initial failure triggers the avalanche the root of the tree. The
branches of the tree are the nodes whose failure was triggered by this initial failure. For
example, in Image 8.20a,b, the breakdown of node A starts the avalanche, hence A is the root of
the tree. The failure of A leads to the failure of B and E, representing the two branches of the
tree. Subsequently E induces the failure of D and B leads to the failure of C (Image 8.21a).

Network Science
persists. When x(t) becomes zero, we loose all active sites and the avalanche ends. In the example
by Albert-László Barabási
shown in the image this happens at t = 5, hence the size of the avalanche is tmax + 1 = 6.
An exact mapping between the branching model and a one dimensional random walk helps us calculate
the avalanche exponent. Consider a branching process starting from a stub with one active end. When
the active site becomes inactive, it decreases the number of its active sites, i.e. x → x − 1. When the
active site branches, creates two active sites, i.e. x → x + 1. This maps the avalanche size s to the time it
takes for the walk that starts at x = 1 to reach x = 0 for the ﬁrst time. This is a much studied process in
random walk theory, predicting that the return time distribution follows a power law with exponent 3/2
[32]. For branching process corresponding to scale-free pk, the avalanche exponent depends on γ, as
shown in Image 8.22.

(d, e, f) Typical avalanches generated by the branching model in the subcritical (d), supercritical (e) and
critical regime (f). The green node in each cascade marks the root of the tree, representing the ﬁrst
perturbation. In (d) and (f) we show multiple trees, while in (e) we show only one, as each tree
(avalanche) grows indeﬁnitely.

The branching model captures the essential features of avalanche propagation (Image 8.21). The
model starts with a single active node. In the next time step each active node produces k
offsprings, where k is selected from a pk distribution. If a node selects k = 0, that branch dies out
(Image 8.21b). If it selects k > 0, it will have k new active sites. The size of an avalanche
corresponds to the size of the tree when all active sites died out (Image 8.21c).

The branching model predicts the same phases as those observed in the cascading failures
model. The phases are now determined only by 〈k〉, hence by the pk distribution:

•  Subcritical Regime: 〈k〉 < 1
For 〈k〉 < 1 on average each branch has less then one offspring. Consequently each tree will
terminate quickly (Image 8.21d). In this regime the avalanche sizes follow an exponential
distribution.
•  Supercritical Regime: 〈k〉 > 1
For 〈k〉 > 1 on average each branch has more than one offspring. Consequently the tree will
continue to grow indefinitely (Image 8.21e). Hence in this regime all avalanches are global.
•  Critical Regime: 〈k〉 = 1
For 〈k〉 = 1 on average each branch has exactly one offspring. Consequently some trees are large
and others die out shortly (Image 8.21e). Numerical simulations indicate that in this regime the
avalanche size distribution follows the power law (8.14).

The branching model can be solved analytically, allowing us to determine the avalanche size
distribution for an arbitrary pk. If pk is exponentially bounded, e.g. it has an exponential tail, the
calculations predict α = 3/2. If, however, pk is scale-free, then the avalanche exponent depends

The dependence of the avalanche exponent α on the degree exponent γ of the network on which the

exponent depends on the degree exponent. Beyond γ = 3, however, the avalanches behave as they
would be spreading on a random network, in which case we have α =3/2.

In summary, we discussed two models that capture the dynamics of cascading failures: the
failure propagation model and the branching model. In the literature we may also encounter the
overload model, which is designed to capture power grid failures [18], or the sandpile model, that
captures the behavior of cascading failures in the critical regime [31, 32]. Other models can also
account for the fact that nodes and links have different capacities to carry traffic [34]. These
models differ in their realism and the number and the nature of their tuning parameters. Yet,
they all predict the existence of a critical state, in which the avalanche sizes follow a power law.

Building Robustness

Can we enhance a network’s robustness? In this section we show that the insights we gained
about the factors that influence robustness allows us to design networks that can
simultaneously resist random failures and attacks. We also discuss how to stop a cascading
failure, allowing us to enhance a system’s dynamical robustness. Finally, we apply the
developed tools to the power grid, linking its robustness to its reliability.

Designing Robust Networks

Designing networks that are simultaneously robust to attacks and random failures appears to be
a conflicting desire [36, 37, 38, 39]. For example, the hub-and-spoke network of Image 8.23a is
robust to random failures, as only the failure of its central node can break the network into
isolated components. Therefore, the probability that a random failure will fragment the network
is 1/N, which is negligible for large N. At the same time this network is vulnerable to attacks, as
the removal of a single node, its central hub, breaks the network into isolated nodes.

8.23b), so that the removal of the hub does not fragment the network. There is a price, however,
by Albert-László Barabási
for this enhanced robustness: it requires us to double the number of links. If we define the cost
to build and maintain a network to be proportional to its average degree 〈k〉, the cost of the
network of Image 8.23b is 24/7, double of the cost 12/7 of the network of Image 8.23a. The
increased cost prompts us to refine our question: Can we maximize the robustness of a network
to both random failures and targeted attacks without changing the cost?

A network’s robustness against random failures is captured by its percolation threshold fc,
which is the fraction of the nodes we must remove for the network to fall apart. To enhance a
network's robustness we must increase fc. According to (8.7) fc depends only on 〈k〉 and 〈k2〉.
Consequently the degree distribution which maximizes fc needs to maximize 〈k2〉 if we wish to
keep the cost 〈k〉 fixed. This is achieved by a bimodal distribution, corresponding to a network
with only two kinds of nodes, with degrees kmin and kmax (Image 8.23a,b).

If we wish to simultaneously optimize the network topology against both random failures and
attacks, we search for topologies that maximize the sum (Image 8.24c)

with degree (8.18), and the rest of the nodes have the same degree kmin. This hub-and-spoke
topology is obviously robust against random failures as the chance of removing the central hub
is 1/N, tiny for large N.

The obtained network may appear to be vulnerable to an attack that removes its hub, but it is
not necessarily so. Indeed, the network’s giant component is held together by both the central
hub as well as by the many nodes with degree kmin, that for kmin > 1 form a giant component on
their own. Hence while the removal of the kmax hub causes a major one-time loss, the remaining
low degree nodes are robust against subsequent targeted removal (Figure 8.24c).

Halting Cascading Failures

Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási

  

Can we avoid cascading failures? The first instinct is to reinforce the network by adding
new links. The problem with reinforcement is that in most real systems the time needed
to establish a new link is much larger than the timescale of a cascading failure. For
example, thanks to regulatory, financial and legal barriers, building a new transmission
line on the power grid can take up to two decades. In contrast, a cascading failure can
sweep the power grid in a few seconds.

In a counterintuitive fashion, the impact of cascading failures can be reduced through
selective node and link removal [40]. To do so we note that each cascading failure has two
parts:

•  Initial failure is the breakdown of the first node or link, representing the source of the
subsequent cascade.
•  Propagation is when the initial failure induces the failure of additional nodes and starts
cascading through the network.

Typically the time interval between (i) and (ii) is much shorter than the time scale over
which the network could be reinforced. Yet, simulations indicate that the size of a cascade
can be reduced if we intentionally remove additional nodes right after the initial failure
(i), but before the failure could propagate. Even though the intentional removal of a node
or a link causes further damage to the network, the removal of a well chosen component
can suppress the cascade propagation [40]. Simulations indicate that to limit the size of
the cascades we must remove nodes with small loads and links with large excess load in
the vicinity of the initial failure. The mechanism is similar to the method used by
firefighters, who set a controlled fire in the fireline to consume the fuel in the path of a
wildfire.

A dramatic manifestation of this approach is provided by the Lazarus effect, the ability to
revive a previously "dead" bacteria, i.e. one that is unable to grow and multiply. This can
be achieved through the knockout of a few well selected genes (Figure 8.25) [41].
Therefore, in a counterintuitive fashion, controlled damage can be beneficial to a
network.

Lazarus Effect
The growth rate of a bacteria is determined by its ability to generate biomass, the molecules it
needs to build its cell wall, DNA and other cellular components. If some key genes are missing,
the bacteria is unable to generate the necessary biomass. Unable to multiply, it will eventually
die. Genes in whose absence the biomass ﬂux is zero are called essential.

The plot shows the biomass ﬂux for E. Coli, a bacteria frequently studied by biologists. The
original mutant is missing an essential gene, hence its biomass ﬂux is zero, as shown on the
vertical axis. Consequently, it cannot multiply. Yet, as the ﬁgure illustrates, by removing ﬁve
additional genes we can turn on the biomass ﬂux. Therefore, counterintuitively, we can revive a
dead organism through the removal of further genes, a phenomena called the Lazarus effect [41].

over 3,000 generators and substations (nodes) and 200,000 km of transmission lines (Image

more robust than expected for a random network with the same degree sequence. After [42].

targ agrees with the numerically observed values. For

To test the relationship between robustness and reliability, we use several quantities, collected
and reported for each power failure: (1) energy not supplied; (2) total loss of power; (3) average
interruption time, measured in minutes per year. The measurements indicate that Group 1

networks, for which the real and the theoretical fc
network size and carry almost as much power and energy as the Group 2 networks. Yet, Group 1
accumulates more than five times the average interruption time, more than two times the
recorded power losses and almost four times the undelivered energy compared to Group 2 [42].
Hence, the national power grids in Group 1 are significantly more fragile than the power grids in
Group 2. This result offers direct evidence that networks that are topologically more robust are
also more reliable. At the same time this finding is rather counterintuitive: One would expect
the denser networks to be more robust. We find, however, that the sparser power grids display
enhanced robustness.

In summary, a better understanding of the network topology is essential to improve the
robustness of complex systems. We can enhance robustness by either designing network
topologies that are simultaneously robust to both random failures and attacks, or by
interventions that limit the spread of cascading failures.

These results may suggest that we should redesign the topology of the Internet and the power
grid to enhance their robustness [44]. Given the opportunity to do so, this could indeed be
achieved. Yet, these infrastructural networks were built incrementally over decades, following
the self-organized growth process described in the previous chapters. Given the enormous cost
of each node and link, it is unlikely that we would ever be given a chance to rebuild them.

Summary: Achilles' Heel

  

The masterminds of the September 11, 2001 did not choose their targets at random: the World
Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon, and the White House (an intended target) in
Washington DC are the hubs of America’s economic, military, and political power [45]. Yet,
while causing a human tragedy far greater than any other event America has experienced since
the Vietnam war, the attacks failed to topple the network. They did offer, however, an excuse to
start new wars, like the Iraq and the Afghan wars, triggering a series of cascading events whose
impact was far more devastating than the 9/11 terrorist attacks themselves. Yet, all networks,
ranging from the economic to the military and the political web, survived. Hence, we can view
9/11 as a tale of robustness and network resilience (BOX 8.5). The roots of this robustness were
uncovered in this chapter: Real networks have a whole hierarchy of hubs. Taking out any one of
them is not sufficient to topple the underlying network.

Box 8.5

Robustness, Resilience, Redundancy

Redundancy and resilience are concepts deeply linked to robustness. It is useful to clarify
the differences between them.

Robustness
A system is robust if it can maintain its basic functions in the presence of internal and
external errors. In a network context robustness refers to the system's ability to carry out
its basic functions even when some of its nodes and links may be missing.

Resilience
A system is resilient if it can adapt to internal and external errors by changing its mode of
operation, without losing its ability to function. Hence resilience is a dynamical property
that requires a shift in the system's core activities.

Redundancy
Redundancy implies the presence of parallel components and functions that, if needed,
can replace a missing component or funciton. Networks show considerable redundancy in
their ability to navigate information between two nodes, thanks to the multiple
independent paths between most node pairs.

The remarkable robustness of real networks represents good news for most complex systems.
Indeed, there are uncountable errors in our cells, from misfolding proteins to the late arrival of a
transcription factor. Yet, the robustness of the underlying cellular network allows our cells to
carry on their normal functions. Network robustness also explains why we rarely notice the
effect of router errors on the Internet or why the disappearance of a species does not result in an
immediate environmental catastrophe.

This topological robustness has its price, however: fragility against attacks. As we showed in
this chapter, the simultaneous removal of several hubs will break any network. This is bad news
for the Internet, as it allows crackers to design strategies that can harm this vital
communication system. It is bad news for economic systems, as it indicates that hub removal
can cripple the whole economy, as vividly illustrated by the 2009 financial meltdown. Yet, it is
good news for drug design, as it suggests that an accurate map of cellular networks can help us
develop drugs that can kill unwanted bacteria or cancer cells.

The message of this chapter is simple: Network topology, robustness, and fragility cannot be
separated from one other. Rather, each complex system has its own Achilles’ Heel: the networks
behind them are simultaneously robust to random failures but vulnerable to attacks.

From Percolation to Robustness: A Brief History
The systematic study of network robustness started with a paper published in Nature (Image 8.1) by
Réka Albert, Hawoong Jeong and Albert-László Barabási [1], reporting the robustness of scale-free
networks to random failures and their fragility to attacks. Yet, the analytical understanding of network
robustness relies on percolation theory. In this context, particularly important were the contributions of
Shlomo Havlin and collaborators, who established the formal link between robustness and percolation
theory and showed that the percolation threshold of a scale-free network is determined by the moments
of the degree distribution. A statistical physicist from Israel, Havlin had multiple contributions to the
study of networks, from discovering the self-similar nature of real networks [46] to exploring the
robustness of layered networks [47].

When considering robustness, we cannot ignore the fact that most systems have numerous
controls and feedback loops that help them survive in the face of errors and failures. Internet
protocols were designed to ‘route around the trouble’, guiding the traffic away from routers that
malfunction; cells have numerous mechanisms to dismantle faulty proteins and to shut down
malfunctioning genes. This chapter documented a new contribution to robustness: the structure
of the underlying network offers a system an enhanced failure tolerance.

The robustness of scale-free networks prompts us to ask: Could this enhanced robustness be the
reason why many real networks are scale-free? Perhaps real systems have developed a scale-
free architecture to satisfy their need for robustness. If this hypothesis is correct we should be

principle that drives the development of real networks. Rather, networks are scale-free thanks
to growth and preferential attachment. It so happens that scale-free networks also have
enhanced robustness. Yet, they are not the most robust networks we could design.

the following process:

•  At each time step add a grain to a randomly chosen node i.
•  If the number of grains at node i reaches or exceeds its bucket size, then it becomes unstable
and all the grains at the node topple to the buckets of its adjacent nodes.
•  If this toppling causes any of the adjacent nodes' buckets to be unstable, subsequent
topplings follow on those nodes, until there is no unstable bucket left. We call this sequence of
toppings an avalanche, its size s being equal to the number of nodes that turned unstable
following an initial perturbation (adding one grain).

Repeat (a)-(c) 104 times. Assume that at each time step a fraction 10–4 of sand grains is lost in
the transfer, so that the network buckets do not become saturated with sand. Study the
avalanche distribution P(s).

Percolation in Scale-free Network

To understand how a scale-free network breaks apart as we approach the threshold (8.7), we
need to determine the corresponding critical exponents γp, βp and ν. The calculations indicate
that the scale-free property alters the value of these exponents, leading to systematic
deviations from the exponents that characterize random networks (SECTION 8.2).

Let us start with the probability P∞ that a randomly selected node belongs to the giant
component. According to (8.2) this follows a power law near pc (or fc in the case of node
removal). The calculations predict that for a scale-free network the exponent βp depends on the
degree exponent γ as [7, 48, 49, 50, 51]

Hence, while for a random network (corresponding to γ > 4) we have βp = 1, for most scale-free

networks of practical interest βp > 1. Therefore, the giant component collapses faster in the

The negative γp for γ < 3 may appear surprising. Note, however, that for γ < 3 we always have a
giant component. Hence, the divergence (8.1) cannot be observed in this regime.

finite clusters follows [48, 50, 51]

Once again, the random network values τ = 5/2 and σ = 1/2 are recovered for γ > 4.

degree exponent γ. This is true even in the range 3 < γ < 4, where the percolation transition
occurs at a finite threshold fc. The mean-field behavior predicted for percolation in infinite
dimensions, capturing the response of a random network to random failures, is recovered only

Attack and Error Tolerance of Real Networks
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
In this section we explore the attack and error curves for the ten reference networks discussed
in Tables 4.1 and (8.2). The corresponding curves are shown in Image 8.29. Their inspection
reveals several patterns, confirming the results discussed in this chapter:

  

• For all networks the error and attack curves separate, confirming the Achilles’ Heel property
(SECTION 8.8): Real networks are robust to random failures but are fragile to attacks.
• The separation between the error and attack curves depends on the average degree and the
degree heterogeneity of each network. For example, for the citation and the actor networks fc for
the attacks is in the vicinity of 0.5 and 0.75, respectively, rather large values. This is because
these networks are rather dense, with 〈k〉 = 20.8 for citation network and 〈k〉 = 83.7 for the actor
network. Hence these networks can survive the removal of a very high fraction of their hubs.

Image 8.29
Error and Attack Curves
The error (green) and attack (purple) curves for the ten reference networks listed in Tables 4.1. The
green vertical line corresponds to the estimated fc
targ for attacks. The estimated fc corresponds to the point where the giant component
corresponds to fc
ﬁrst drops below 1% of its original size. In most systems this procedure offers a good approximation for
fc. The only exception is the metabolic network, for which fc

http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/8#percolation-theory

The goal of this section is to derive (8.12), providing the attack threshold of a scale-free

network. We aim to calculate fc for an uncorrelated scalefree network, generated by the
by Albert-László Barabási
configuration model with pk = c ⋅ k−γ where k = kmin ,…, kmax and c ≈ (γ − 1)/(kmin
−γ+1 − kmax

−γ+1 ).

  

The removal of an f fraction of nodes in a decreasing order of their degree (hub removal) has two
effects [9, 51]:

• The maximum degree of the network changes from kmax to k'max.
• The links connected to the removed hubs are also removed, changing the degree distribution
of the remaining network.

The resulting network is still uncorrelated, therefore we can use the Molloy-Reed criteria to
determine the existence of a giant component.

We start by considering the impact of (i). The new upper cutoff, k'max, is given by

Equation (8.52) provides the new maximum degree of the network after we remove an f fraction
of the hubs.

(8. 52)

Next we turn to (ii), accounting for the fact that hub removal changes the degree distribution pk
→ p'k . In the absence of degree correlations we assume that the links of the removed hubs
connect to randomly selected stubs. Consequently, we calculate the fraction of links removed
‘randomly’, f ̃, as a consequence of removing an f fraction of the hubs:

For γ → 2 we have f ̃ → 1, which means that the removal of a tiny fraction of the hubs removes all

for γ = 2 the hubs dominate the network.

The Optimal Degree Distribution

In this section we derive the bimodal degree distribution that simultaneously optimizes a

To determine the threshold for targeted attack, we must consider the fact that we have only two
types of nodes, i.e. an r fraction of nodes have degree kmax and the remaining (1 − r) fraction
have degree kmin. Hence hub removal can either remove all hubs (case (i)), or only some fraction
of them (case (ii)):

Section 9.1

Introduction

Belgium appears to be the model bicultural society: 59% of its citizens are Flemish, speaking
Dutch and 40% are Walloons who speak French. As multiethnic countries break up all over the
world, we must ask: How did this country foster the peaceful coexistence of these two ethnic
groups since 1830? Is Belgium a densely knitted society, where it does not matter if one is
Flemish or Walloon? Or we have two nations within the same borders, that learned to minimize
contact with each other?

The answer was provided by Vincent Blondel and his students in 2007, who developed an
algorithm to identify the country’s community structure. They started from the mobile call
network, placing individuals next to whom they regularly called on their mobile phone [2]. The
algorithm revealed that Belgium’s social network is broken into two large clusters of
communities and that individuals in one of these clusters rarely talk with individuals from the
other cluster (Image 9.1). The origin of this separation became obvious once they assigned to
each node the language spoken by each individual, learning that one cluster consisted almost
exclusively of French speakers and the other collected the Dutch speakers.

In network science we call a community a group of nodes that have a higher likelihood of
connecting to each other than to nodes from other communities. To gain intuition about
community organization, next we discuss two areas where communities play a particularly
important role:

  

•  Social Networks
Social networks are full of easy to spot communities, something that scholars have noticed
decades ago [3,4,5,6,7]. Indeed, the employees of a company are more likely to interact with
their coworkers than with employees of other companies [3]. Consequently work places appear
as densely interconnected communities within the social network. Communities could also
represent circles of friends, or a group of individuals who pursue the same hobby together, or
individuals living in the same neighborhood.

A social network that has received particular attention in the context of community detection is
known as Zachary’s Karate Club (Image 9.2) [7], capturing the links between 34 members of a
karate club. Given the club's small size, each club member knew everyone else. To uncover the
true relationships between club members, sociologist Wayne Zachary documented 78 pairwise
links between members who regularly interacted outside the club (Image 9.2a).

The interest in the dataset is driven by a singular event: A conflict between the club’s president
and the instructor split the club into two. About half of the members followed the instructor and
the other half the president, a breakup that unveiled the ground truth, representing club's
underlying community structure (Image 9.2a). Today community finding algorithms are often
tested based on their ability to infer these two communities from the structure of the network
before the split.

follow the split: The white and purple communities capture one fraction and the green-orange

•  The citation history of the Zachary karate club paper [7] mirrors the history of community detection in

network science. Indeed, there was virtually no interest in Zachary’s paper until Girvan and Newman
by Albert-László Barabási
used it as a benchmark for community detection in 2002 [9]. Since then the number of citations to the
paper exploded, reminiscent of the citation explosion to Erdős and Rényi’s work following the discovery
of scale-free networks (Image 3.15).

  

The frequent use Zachary’s Karate Club network as a benchmark in community detection inspired the
Zachary Karate Club Club, whose tongue-in-cheek statute states: “The ﬁrst scientist at any conference
on networks who uses Zachary's karate club as an example is inducted into the Zachary Karate Club
Club, and awarded a prize.”

Hence the prize is not based on merit, but on the simple act of participation. Yet, its recipients are
prominent network scientists (http://networkkarate.tumblr.com/). The ﬁgure shows the Zachary Karate
Club trophy, which is always held by the latest inductee. Photo courtesy of Marián Boguñá.

•  Biological Networks
Communities play a particularly important role in our understanding of how specific biological
functions are encoded in cellular networks. Two years before receiving the Nobel Prize in
Medicine, Lee Hartwell argued that biology must move beyond its focus on single genes. It must
explore instead how groups of molecules form functional modules to carry out a specific cellular
functions [10]. Ravasz and collaborators [11] made the first attempt to systematically identify
such modules in metabolic networks. They did so by building an algorithm to identify groups of
molecules that form locally dense communities (Image 9.3).

Communities play a particularly important role in understanding human diseases. Indeed,
proteins that are involved in the same disease tend to interact with each other [12,13]. This
finding inspired the disease module hypothesis [14], stating that each disease can be linked to a
well-defined neighborhood of the cellular network.

The examples discussed above illustrate the diverse motivations that drive community
identification. The existence of communities is rooted in who connects to whom, hence they
cannot be explained based on the degree distribution alone. To extract communities we must
therefore inspect a network’s detailed wiring diagram. These examples inspire the starting
hypothesis of this chapter:

H1: Fundamental Hypothesis

A network’s community structure is uniquely encoded in its wiring diagram.

According to the fundamental hypothesis there is a ground truth about a network’s community
organization, that can be uncovered by inspecting Aij.

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the concepts necessary to understand and identify
the community structure of a complex network. We will ask how to define communities, explore
the various community characteristics and introduce a series of algorithms, relying on different
principles, for community identification.

Section 9.2

Basics of Communities

What do we really mean by a community? How many communities are in a network? How many
different ways can we partition a network into communities? In this section we address these
frequently emerging questions in community identification.

Communities are locally dense connected subgraphs in a network. This expectation relies on two

Each community corresponds to a connected subgraph, like the subgraphs formed by the orange, green

is limited to only one component. The hypothesis also implies that on the same component a community
cannot consist of two subgraphs that do not have a link to each other. Consequently, the orange and the

H2: Connectedness and Density Hypothesis

A community is a locally dense connected subgraph in a network.

In other words, all members of a community must be reached through other members of the
same community (connectedness). At the same time we expect that nodes that belong to a
community have a higher probability to link to the other members of that community than to
nodes that do not belong to the same community (density). While this hypothesis considerably
narrows what would be considered a community, it does not uniquely define it. Indeed, as we
discuss below, several community definitions are consistent with H2.

Maximum Cliques
One of the first papers on community structure, published in 1949, defined a community as
group of individuals whose members all know each other [5]. In graph theoretic terms this
means that a community is a complete subgraph, or a clique. A clique automatically satisfies H2: it
is a connected subgraph with maximal link density. Yet, viewing communities as cliques has
several drawbacks:

•  While triangles are frequent in networks, larger cliques are rare.
•  Requiring a community to be a complete subgraph may be too restrictive, missing many other
legitimate communities. For example, none of the communities of Image 9.2 and 9.3 correspond
to complete subgraphs.

Strong and Weak Communities
To relax the rigidity of cliques, consider a connected subgraph C of NC nodes in a network. The

internal degree ki

external degree ki

int of node i is the number of links that connect i to other nodes in C. The
ext is the number of links that connect i to the rest of the network. If ki

ext=0,

each neighbor of i is within C, hence C is a good community for node i. If ki
should be assigned to a different community. These definitions allow us to distinguish two kinds
of communities (Image 9.5):

int=0, then node i

C is a strong community if each node within C has more links within the community than with the

rest of the graph [15,16]. Specifically, a subgraph C forms a strong community if for each node i ∈

A weak community relaxes the strong community requirement by allowing some nodes to
violate (9.1). In other words, the inequality (9.2) applies to the community as a whole rather
than to each node individually.

Note that each clique is a strong community, and each strong community is a weak community.
The converse is generally not true (Image 9.5).

The community definitions discussed above (cliques, strong and weak communities) refine our
notions of communities. At the same time they indicate that we do have some freedom in
defining communities.

Number of Communities

How many ways can we group the nodes of a network into communities? To answer this
question consider the simplest community finding problem, called graph bisection: We aim to
divide a network into two non-overlapping subgraphs, such that the number of links between
the nodes in the two groups, called the cut size, is minimized (BOX 9.1).

Graph Partitioning
We can solve the graph bisection problem by inspecting all possible divisions into two groups
and choosing the one with the smallest cut size. To determine the computational cost of this
brute force approach we note that the number of distinct ways we can partition a network of N
nodes into groups of N1 and N2 nodes is

To illustrate the implications of (9.5) consider a network with ten nodes which we bisect into
two subgraphs of size N1 = N2 = 5. According to (9.3) we need to check 252 bisections to find the
one with the smallest cut size. Let us assume that our computer can inspect these 252 bisections
in one millisecond (10-3 sec). If we next wish to bisect a network with a hundred nodes into
groups with N1 = N2 = 50, according to (9.3) we need to check approximately 1029 divisions,
requiring about 1016 years on the same computer. Therefore our brute-force strategy is bound to
fail, being impossible to inspect all bisections for even a modest size network.

Graph Partitioning

Chip designers face a problem of exceptional complexity: They need to place on a chip 2.5
billion transistors such that their wires do not intersect. To simplify the problem they
first partition the wiring diagram of an integrated circuit (IC) into smaller subgraphs,
chosen such that the number of links between them to be minimal. Then they lay out
different blocks of an IC individually, and reconnect these blocks. A similar problem is
encountered in parallel computing, when a large computational problem is partitioned
into subtasks and assigned to individual chips. The assignment must minimize the
typically slow communication between the processors.

The problem faced by chip designers or software engineers is called graph partitioning in
computer science [17]. The algorithms developed for this purpose, like the widely used
Kerninghan-Lin algorithm (Image 9.6), are the predecessors of the community finding
algorithms discussed in this chapter.

There is an important difference between graph partitioning and community detection:
Graph partitioning divides a network into a predefined number of smaller subgraphs. In
contrast community detection aims to uncover the inherent community structure of a
network. Consequently in most community detection algorithms the number and the size
of the communities is not predefined, but needs to be discovered by inspecting the
network’s wiring diagram.

Image 9.6
Kerninghan-Lin Algorithm
The best known algorithm for graph partitioning was proposed in 1970 [18]. We illustrate this with
graph bisection which starts by randomly partitioning the network into two groups of predeﬁned
sizes. Next we select a node pair (i,j), where i and j belong to different groups, and swap them,
recording the resulting change in the cut size. By testing all (i,j) pairs we identify the pair that
results in the largest reduction of the cut size, like the pair highlighted in (a). By swapping them
we arrive to the partition shown in (b). In some implementations of the algorithm if no pair
reduces the cut size, we swap the pair that increases the cut size the least.

Community Detection
While in graph partitioning the number and the size of communities is predefined, in
community detection both parameters are unknown. We call a partition a division of a network
into an arbitrary number of groups, such that each node belongs to one and only one group. The

In summary, our notion of communities rests on the expectation that each community
corresponds to a locally dense connected subgraph. This hypothesis leaves room for numerous
community definitions, from cliques to weak and strong communities. Once we adopt a
definition, we could identify communities by inspecting all possible partitions of a network,
selecting the one that best satisfies our definition. Yet, the number of partitions grows faster
than exponentially with the network size, making such brute-force approaches computationally
infeasible. We therefore need algorithms that can identify communities without inspecting all
partitions. This is the subject of the next sections.

Box 9.2

NP Completeness

How long does it take to execute an algorithm? The answer is not given in minutes and
hours, as the execution time depends on the speed of the computer on which we run the
algorithm. We count instead the number of computations the algorithm performs. For
example an algorithm that aims to find the largest number in a list of N numbers has to
compare each number in the list with the maximum found so far. Consequently its
execution time is proportional to N. In general, we call an algorithm polynomial if its
execution time follows Nx.

An algorithm whose execution time is proportional to N3 is slower on any computer than
an algorithm whose execution time is N. But this difference dwindles in significance
compared to an exponential algorithm, whose execution time increases as 2N. For
example, if an algorithm whose execution time is proportional to N takes a second for N =
100 elements, then an N3 algorithm takes almost three hours on the same computer. Yet
an exponential algorithm (2N) will take 1020 years to complete.

The problem that an algorithm can solve in polynomial time is called a class P problem.
Several computational problems encountered in network science have no known
polynomial time algorithms, but the available algorithms require exponential running
time. Yet, the correctness of the solution can be checked quickly, i.e. in polynomial time.
Such problems, called NP-complete, include the traveling salesman problem (Image 9.8),
the graph coloring problem, maximum clique identification, partitioning a graph into
subgraphs of specific type, and the vertex cover problem (Box 7.4).

The ramifications of NP-completeness has captured the fascination of the popular media

Hierarchical Clustering

To uncover the community structure of large real networks we need algorithms whose running
time grows polynomially with N. Hierarchical clustering, the topic of this section, helps us achieve
this goal.

The starting point of hierarchical clustering is a similarity matrix, whose elements xij indicate the
distance of node i from node j. In community identification the similarity is extracted from the
relative position of nodes i and j within the network.

Once we have xij, hierarchical clustering iteratively identifies groups of nodes with high
similarity. We can use two different procedures to achieve this: agglomerative algorithms merge
nodes with high similarity into the same community, while divisive algorithms isolate
communities by removing low similarity links that tend to connect communities. Both
procedures generate a hierarchical tree, called a dendrogram, that predicts the possible
community partitions. Next we explore the use of agglomerative and divisive algorithms to
identify communities in networks.

Agglomerative Procedures: the Ravasz Algorithm

We illustrate the use of agglomerative hierarchical clustering for community detection by
discussing the Ravasz algorithm, proposed to identify functional modules in metabolic networks
[11]. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

Step 1: Define the Similarity Matrix

community and low for node pairs that belong to different communities. In a network context

Step 2: Decide Group Similarity
As nodes are merged into small communities, we must measure how similar two communities
are. Three approaches, called single, complete and average cluster similarity, are frequently used to
calculate the community similarity from the node-similarity matrix xij (Image 9.10). The Ravasz
algorithm uses the average cluster similarity method, defining the similarity of two communities
as the average of xij over all node pairs i and j that belong to distinct communities (Image 9.10d).

In agglomerative clustering we need to determine the similarity of two communities from the node

•  Single Linkage Clustering
The similarity between communities 1 and 2 is the smallest of all xij , where i and j are in different
communities. Hence the similarity is x12=1.59, corresponding to the distance between nodes C and E.
•  Complete Linkage Clustering
The similarity between two communities is the maximum of xij , where i and j are in distinct
communities. Hence x12=3.97.
•  Average Linkage Clustering
The similarity between two communities is the average of xij over all node pairs i and j that belong to
different communities. This is the procedure implemented in the Ravasz algorithm, providing x12=2.84.

Step 3: Apply Hierarchical Clustering
The Ravasz algorithm uses the following procedure to identify the communities:

• Assign each node to a community of its own and evaluate xij for all node pairs.
• Find the community pair or the node pair with the highest similarity and merge them into a
single community.
• Calculate the similarity between the new community and all other communities.
• Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all nodes form a single community.

Step 4: Dendrogram
The pairwise mergers of Step 3 will eventually pull all nodes into a single community. We can
use a dendrogram to extract the underlying community organization.

The dendrogram visualizes the order in which the nodes are assigned to specific communities.
For example, the dendrogram of Image 9.9b tells us that the algorithm first merged nodes A

To identify the communities we must cut the dendrogram. Hierarchical clustering does not tell
us where that cut should be. Using for example the cut indicated as a dashed line in Image 9.9b,
we recover the three obvious communities (ABC, EFG, and HIJK).

Applied to the E. coli metabolic network (Image 9.3a), the Ravasz algorithm identifies the nested
community structure of bacterial metabolism. To check the biological relevance of these
communities, we color-coded the branches of the dendrogram according to the known
biochemical classification of each metabolite. As shown in Image 9.3b, substrates with similar
biochemical role tend to be located on the same branch of the tree. In other words the known
biochemical classification of these metabolites confirms the biological relevance of the

Step 1: The calculation of the similarity matrix xij
the number of computations scale as N2. In other words its computational complexity is 0(N2).

Step 2: Group similarity requires us to determine in each step the distance of the new cluster to
all other clusters. Doing this N times requires 0(N2) calculations.

Steps 3 & 4: The construction of the dendrogram can be performed in 0(NlogN) steps.

Combining Steps 1-4, we find that the number of required computations scales as 0(N2) + 0(N2)
+ 0(NlogN). As the slowest step scales as 0(N2), the algorithm’s computational complexity is
0(N2). Hence hierarchal clustering is much faster than the brute force approach, which generally
scales as 0(eN).

Divisive Procedures: the Girvan-Newman Algorithm

Divisive procedures systematically remove the links connecting nodes that belong to different
communities, eventually breaking a network into isolated communities. We illustrate their use
by introducing an algorithm proposed by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman [9,23], consisting
of the following steps:

Step 1: Define Centrality
While in agglomerative algorithms xij selects node pairs that belong to the same community, in
divisive algorithms xij, called centrality, selects node pairs that are in different communities.
Hence we want xij to be high (or low) if nodes i and j belong to different communities and small
if they are in the same community. Three centrality measures that satisfy this expectation are
discussed in Image 9.11. The fastest of the three is link betweenness, defining xij as the number of
shortest paths that go through the link (i, j). Links connecting different communities are
expected to have large xij while links within a community have small xij.

Centrality Measures
Divisive algorithms require a centrality measure that is high for nodes that belong to different
communities and is low for node pairs in the same community. Two frequently used measures can
achieve this:
•  Link Betweenness
Link betweenness captures the role of each link in information transfer. Hence xij is proportional to the
number of shortest paths between all node pairs that run along the link (i,j). Consequently, inter-
community links, like the central link in the ﬁgure with xij =0.57, have large betweenness. The calculation
of link betweenness scales as 0(LN), or 0(N2) for a sparse network [23].

A pair of nodes m and n are chosen at random. A walker starts at m, following each adjacent link with

equal probability until it reaches n. Random walk betweenness xij is the probability that the link i→j was
crossed by the walker after averaging over all possible choices for the starting nodes m and n. The
calculation requires the inversion of an NxN matrix, with 0(N3) computational complexity and averaging
the ﬂows over all node pairs, with 0(LN2). Hence the total computational complexity of random walk
betweenness is 0[(L + N) N2], or 0(N3) for a sparse network.

The Girvan-Newman Algorithm
Network Science
Divisive algorithms require a centrality measure that is high for nodes that belong to different
by Albert-László Barabási
communities and is low for node pairs in the same community. Two frequently used measures can
achieve this:

  

(a) The divisive hierarchical algorithm of Girvan and Newman uses link betweenness (Image 9.11a) as
centrality. In the ﬁgure the link weights, assigned proportionally to xij, indicate that links connecting
different communities have the highest xij. Indeed, each shortest path between these communities
must run through them.

(b)-(d) The sequence of images illustrates how the algorithm removes one-by-one the three highest xij
links, leaving three isolated communities behind. Note that betweenness needs to be recalculated after
each link removal.

(e) The dendrogram generated by the Girvan-Newman algorithm. The cut at level 3, shown as an orange
dotted line, reproduces the three communities present in the network.

(f) The modularity function, M, introduced in SECTION 9.4, helps us select the optimal cut. Its maxima
agrees with our expectation that the best cut is at level 3, as shown in (e).

Computational Complexity
The rate limiting step of divisive algorithms is the calculation of centrality. Consequently the
algorithm’s computational complexity depends on which centrality measure we use. The most
efficient is link betweenness, with 0(LN) [24,25,26] (Image 9.11a). Step 3 of the algorithm
introduces an additional factor L in the running time, hence the algorithm scales as 0(L2N), or
0(N3) for a sparse network.

Hierarchy in Real Networks

Hierarchical clustering raises two fundamental questions:

Nested Communities
First, it assumes that small modules are nested into larger ones. These nested communities are
well captured by the dendrogram (Image 9.9b and 9.12e). How do we know, however, if such
hierarchy is indeed present in a network? Could this hierarchy be imposed by our algorithms,
whether or not the underlying network has a nested community structure? Communities and
the Scale-Free Property Second, the density hypothesis states that a network can be partitioned
into a collection of subgraphs that are only weakly linked to other subgraphs. How can we have
isolated communities in a scale-free network, if the hubs inevitably link multiple communities?

The hierarchical network model, whose construction is shown in Image 9.13, resolves the conflict

Hierarchical Network
The iterative construction of a deterministic hierarchical network.
•  Start from a fully connected module of ﬁve nodes. Note that the diagonal nodes are also connected,
but the links are not visible.
•  Create four identical replicas of the starting module and connect the peripheral nodes of each module
to the central node of the original module. This way we obtain a network with N=25 nodes.
•  Create four replicas of the 25-node module and connect the peripheral nodes again to the central
node of the original module, obtaining an N=125-node network. This process is continued indeﬁnitely.

Size Independent Clustering Coefficient
While for the Erdős-Rényi and the Barabási-Albert models the clustering coefficient decreases
with N (SECTION 5.9), for the hierarchical network we have C=0.743 independent of the network
size (Image 9.14c). Such N-independent clustering coefficient has been observed in metabolic
networks [11].

Hierarchical Modularity
The model consists of numerous small communities that form larger communities, which again
combine into ever larger communities. The quantitative signature of this nested hierarchical
modularity is the dependence of a node’s clustering coefficient on the node’s degree [11,27,28]

k−1

C(k) ∼
In other words, the higher a node’s degree, the smaller is its clustering coefficient.

(9. 8)

Equation (9.8) captures the way the communities are organized in a network. Indeed, small
degree nodes have high C because they reside in dense communities. High degree nodes have
small C because they connect to different communities. For example, in Image 9.13c the nodes at
the center of the five-node modules have k=4 and clustering coefficient C=4. Those at the center
of a 25-node module have k=20 and C=3/19. Those at the center of the 125-node modules have
k=84 and C=3/83. Hence the higher the degree of a node, the smaller is its C.

The hierarchical network model suggests that inspecting C(k) allows us to decide if a network is
hierarchical. For the Erdős-Rényi and the Barabási-Albert models C(k) is independent of k,
indicating that they do not display hierarchical modularity. To see if hierarchical modularity is
present in real systems, we calculated C(k) for ten reference networks, finding that (Image 9.36):

•  Only the power grid lacks hierarchical modularity, its C(k) being independent of k (Image
9.36a).
•  For the remaining nine networks C(k) decreases with k. Hence in these networks small nodes

network models predict C(k)~k-β, where β is between 0 and 2 [27,28].

Scaling in Hierarchical Networks
Three quantities characterize the hierarchical network shown in Image 9.13:
•  Degree Distribution
The scale-free nature of the generated network is illustrated by the scaling of pk with slope γ=ln 5/ln 4,
shown as a dashed line. See ADVANCED TOPICS 9.A for the derivation of the degree exponent.
•  Hierarchical Clustering
C(k) follows (9.8), shown as a dashed line. The circles show C(k) for a randomly wired scale-free
network, obtained from the original model by degree-preserving randomization. The lack of scaling
indicates that the hierarchical architecture is lost under rewiring. Hence C(k) captures a property that
goes beyond the degree distribution.
•  Size Independent Clustering Coefﬁcient
The dependence of the clustering coefﬁcient C on the network size N. For the hierarchical model C is
independent of N (ﬁlled symbols), while for the Barabási-Albert model C(N) decreases (empty symbols).

After [27].

In summary, in principle hierarchical clustering does not require preliminary knowledge about
the number and the size of communities. In practice it generates a dendrogram that offers a
family of community partitions characterizing the studied network. This dendrogram does not
tell us which partition captures best the underlying community structure. Indeed, any cut of the
hierarchical tree offers a potentially valid partition (Image 9.15). This is at odds with our
expectation that in each network there is a ground truth, corresponding to a unique community
structure.

Ambiguity in Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering does not tell us where to cut a dendrogram. Indeed, depending on where we
make the cut in the dendrogram of Image 9.9a, we obtain (b) two, (c) three or (d) four communities.
While for a small network we can visually decide which cut captures best the underlying community
structure, it is impossible to do so in larger networks. In the next section we discuss modularity, that
helps us select the optimal cut.

Section 9.4

Modularity

In a randomly wired network the connection pattern between the nodes is expected to be
uniform, independent of the network's degree distribution. Consequently these networks are
not expected to display systematic local density fluctuations that we could interpret as
communities. This expectation inspired the third hypothesis of community organization:

H3: Random Hypothesis
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
Randomly wired networks lack an inherent community structure.

  

This hypothesis has some actionable consequences: By comparing the link density of a
community with the link density obtained for the same group of nodes for a randomly rewired
network, we could decide if the original community corresponds to a dense subgraph, or its
connectivity pattern emerged by chance.

In this section we show that systematic deviations from a random configuration allow us to
define a quantity called modularity, that measures the quality of each partition. Hence
modularity allows us to decide if a particular community partition is better than some other one.
Finally, modularity optimization offers a novel approach to community detection.

Modularity

Consider a network with N nodes and L links and a partition into nc communities, each
community having Nc nodes connected to each other by Lc links, where c=1,...,nc. If Lc is larger
than the expected number of links between the Nc nodes given the network’s degree sequence,
then the nodes of the subgraph Cc could indeed be part of a true community, as expected based
on the Density Hypothesis H2 (Image 9.2). We therefore measure the difference between the
network’s real wiring diagram (Aij) and the expected number of links between i and j if the
network is randomly wired (pij),

Mc

Here pij can be determined by randomizing the original network, while keeping the expected
degree of each node unchanged. Using the degree preserving null model (7.1) we have

If Mc is positive, then the subgraph Cc has more links than expected by chance, hence it
represents a potential community. If Mc is zero then the connectivity between the Nc nodes is
random, fully explained by the degree distribution. Finally, if Mc is negative, then the nodes of Cc
do not form a community.

Using (9.10) we can derive a simpler form for the modularity (9.9) (ADVANCED TOPICS 9.B)

Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
To generalize these ideas to a full network consider the complete partition that breaks the
network into nc communities. To see if the local link density of the subgraphs defined by this
partition differs from the expected density in a randomly wired network, we define the
partition’s modularity by summing (9.11) over all nc communities [23]

Modularity has several key properties:

•  Higher Modularity Implies Better Partition
The higher is M for a partition, the better is the corresponding community structure. Indeed, in
Image 9.16a the partition with the maximum modularity (M=0.41) accurately captures the two
obvious communities. A partition with a lower modularity clearly deviates from these
communities (Image 9.16b). Note that the modularity of a partition cannot exceed one [31,32].
•  Zero and Negative Modularity
By taking the whole network as a single community we obtain M=0, as in this case the two terms
in the parenthesis of (9.12) are equal (Image 9.16c). If each node belongs to a separate
community, we have Lc=0 and the sum (9.12) has nc negative terms, hence M is negative (Image
9.16d).

Modularity
by Albert-László Barabási
To better understand the meaning of modularity, we show M deﬁned in (9.12) for several partitions of a
network with two obvious communities.
•  Optimal Partition
The partition with maximal modularity M=0.41 closely matches the two distinct communities.
•  Suboptimal Partition
A partition with a sub-optimal but positive modularity, M=0.22, fails to correctly identify the communities
present in the network.
•  Single Community
If we assign all nodes to the same community we obtain M=0, independent of the network structure.
•  Negative Modularity
If we assign each node to a different community, modularity is negative, obtaining M=-0.12.

We can use modularity to decide which of the many partitions predicted by a hierarchical
method offers the best community structure, selecting the one for which M is maximal. This is
illustrated in Image 9.12f, which shows M for each cut of the dendrogram, finding a clear
maximum when the network breaks into three communities.

The Greedy Algorithm

The expectation that partitions with higher modularity corresponds to partitions that more
accurately capture the underlying community structure prompts us to formulate our final
hypothesis:

H4: Maximal Modularity Hypothesis

For a given network the partition with maximum modularity corresponds to the optimal community
structure.

The hypothesis is supported by the inspection of small networks, for which the maximum M
agrees with the expected communities (Image 9.12 and 9.16).

The maximum modularity hypothesis is the starting point of several community detection
algorithms, each seeking the partition with the largest modularity. In principle we could
identify the best partition by checking M for all possible partitions, selecting the one for which
M is largest. Given, however, the exceptionally large number of partitions, this bruteforce
approach is computationally not feasible. Next we discuss an algorithm that finds partitions
with close to maximal M, while bypassing the need to inspect all partitions.

• Assign each node to a community of its own, starting with N communities of single nodes.
• Inspect each community pair connected by at least one link and compute the modularity
difference ΔM obtained if we merge them. Identify the community pair for which ΔM is the
largest and merge them. Note that modularity is always calculated for the full network.
• Repeat Step 2 until all nodes merge into a single community, recording M for each step.
• Select the partition for which M is maximal.

To illustrate the predictive power of the greedy algorithm consider the collaboration network
between physicists, consisting of N=56,276 scientists in all branches of physics who posted
papers on arxiv.org (Image 9.17). The greedy algorithm predicts about 600 communities with
peak modularity M = 0.713. Four of these communities are very large, together containing 77% of
all nodes (Image 9.17a). In the largest community 93% of the authors publish in condensed
matter physics while 87% of the authors in the second largest community publish in high energy
physics, indicating that each community contains physicists of similar professional interests.
The accuracy of the greedy algorithm is also illustrated in Image 9.2a, showing that the
community structure with the highest M for the Zachary Karate Club accurately captures the
club’s subsequent split.

Computational Complexity
Since the calculation of each ΔM can be done in constant time, Step 2 of the greedy algorithm
requires O(L) computations. After deciding which communities to merge, the update of the
matrix can be done in a worstcase time O(N). Since the algorithm requires N–1 community
mergers, its complexity is O[(L + N)N], or O(N2) on a sparse graph. Optimized implementations
reduce the algorithm’s complexity to O(Nlog2N) (Online Resource 9.1).

Limits of Modularity

Given the important role modularity plays in community identification, we must be aware of
some of its limitations.

Resolution Limit
Modularity maximization forces small communities into larger ones [34]. Indeed, if we merge
communities A and B into a single community, the network’s modularity changes with

where lAB is number of links that connect the nodes in community A with total degree kA to the
nodes in community B with total degree kB. If A and B are distinct communities, they should
remain distinct when M is maximized. As we show next, this is not always the case.

Consider the case when kAkB|2L < 1, in which case (9.13) predicts ΔMAB > 0 if there is at least one
link between the two communities (lAB ≥ 1). Hence we must merge A and B to maximize
modularity. Assuming for simplicity that kA ~ kB= k, if the total degree of the communities
satisfies

2L‾‾‾√

k ≤
then modularity increases by merging A and B into a single community, even if A and B are
otherwise distinct communities. This is an artifact of modularity maximization: if kA and kB are
under the threshold (9.14), the expected number of links between them is smaller than one.
Hence even a single link between them will force the two communities together when we

Modularity-based Algorithms
There are several widely used community ﬁnding algorithms that maximize modularity.

Optimized Greedy Algorithm
The use of data structures for sparse matrices can decrease the greedy algorithm’s computational
complexity to 0(Nlog2N) [35]. See http://cs.unm.edu/~aaron/research/fastmodularity. htm for the code.

Louvain Algorithm
The modularity optimization algorithm achieves a computational complexity of 0(L) [2]. Hence it allows
us to identify communities in networks with millions of nodes, as illustrated in Figure 9.1. The algorithm
is described in ADVANCED TOPICS 9.C. See https:// sites.google.com/site/ﬁndcommunities/ for the
code

To avoid the resolution limit we can further subdivide the large communities obtained by
modularity optimization [33,34,39]. For example, treating the smaller of the two condensed-
matter groups of Image 9.17a as a separate network and feeding it again into the greedy
algorithm, we obtain about 100 smaller communities with an increased modularity M = 0.807
(Image 9.17b) [33].

Modularity Maxima
All algorithms based on maximal modularity rely on the assumption that a network with a clear
community structure has an optimal partition with a maximal M [40]. In practice we hope that
Mmax is an easy to find maxima and that the communities predicted by all other partitions are
distinguishable from those corresponding to Mmax. Yet, as we show next, this optimal partition
is difficult to identify among a large number of close to optimal partitions.

we assign each cluster randomly to communities, even clusters that have no links to each other, like the
ﬁve highlighted clusters, may end up in the same community. The modularity of this random partition is
still high, M=0.80, not too far from the optimal M=0.87.

We lack, therefore, a clear modularity maxima - instead the modularity function is highly degenerate.
After [40].

After [33].

In summary, modularity offers a first principle understanding of a network's community
structure. Indeed, (9.16) incorporates in a compact form a number of essential questions, like
what we mean by a community, how we choose the appropriate null model, and how we
measure the goodness of a particular partition. Consequently modularity optimization plays a
central role in the community finding literature.

At the same time, modularity has several well-known limitations: First, it forces together small
weakly connected communities. Second, networks lack a clear modularity maxima, developing
instead a modularity plateau containing many partitions with hard to distinguish modularity.
This plateau explains why numerous modularity maximization algorithms can rapidly identify a
high M partition: They identify one of the numerous partitions with close to optimal M. Finally,
analytical calculations and numerical simulations indicate that even random networks contain
high modularity partitions, at odds with the random hypothesis H3 that motivated the concept
of modularity [41-43].

Modularity optimization is a special case of a larger problem: Finding communities by
optimizing some quality function Q. The greedy algorithm and the Louvain algorithm described
in ADVANCED TOPICS 9.C assume that Q = M, seeking partitions with maximal modularity. In
ADVANCED TOPICS 9.C we also describe the Infomap algorithm, that finds communities by
minimizing the map equation L, an entropy-based measure of the partition quality [44-46].

Clique Percolation

The clique percolation algorithm, often called CFinder, views a community as the union of
overlapping cliques [36]:

• Two k-cliques are considered adjacent if they share k – 1 nodes (Image 9.20b).
• A k-clique community is the largest connected subgraph obtained by the union of all adjacent
k-cliques (Image 9.20c).
• k-cliques that can not be reached from a particular k-clique belong to other k-clique
communities (Image 9.20c,d).

The CFinder algorithm identifies all cliques and then builds an Nclique x Nclique clique–clique
overlap matrix O, where Nclique is the number of cliques and Oij is the number of nodes shared by
cliques i and j (Image 9.39). A typical output of the CFinder algorithm is shown in Image 9.21,
displaying the community structure of the word bright. In the network two words are linked to
each other if they have a related meaning. We can easily check that the overlapping
communities identified by the algorithm are meaningful: The word bright simultaneously
belongs to a community containing light-related words, like glow or dark; to a community
capturing colors (yellow, brown); to a community consisting of astronomical terms (sun, ray); and
to a community linked to intelligence (gifted, brilliant). The example also illustrates the difficulty
the earlier algorithms would have in identifying communities of this network: they would force
bright into one of the four communities and remove from the other three. Hence communities
would be stripped of a key member, leading to outcomes that are difficult to interpret.

share a link with the green triangles, the green community has been completed. Note that there can be
multiple k-clique communities in the same network. We illustrate this by showing a second community

k-clique community has its own threshold:

•  For k=2 the k-cliques are links and (9.16) reduces to pc(k)~1/N, which is the condition for the
emergence of a giant connected component in Erdős–Rényi networks.

The Clique Percolation Algorithm (CFinder)
Random networks built with probabilities p=0.13 (a) and p=0.22 (b). As both p's are larger than the link
percolation threshold (pc=1/N=0.05 for N=20), in both cases most nodes belong to a giant component.
•  Subcritical Communities
The 3-clique (triangle) percolation threshold is pc(3)=0.16 according to (9.16), hence at p=0.13 we are
below it. Therefore, only two small 3-clique percolation clusters are observed, which do not connect to
each other.
•  Supercritical Communities
For p=0.22 we are above pc(3), hence we observe multiple 3-cliques that form a giant 3-clique
percolation cluster (purple). This network also has a second overlapping 3-clique community, shown in
green.

Computational Complexity
Finding cliques in a network requires algorithms whose running time grows exponentially with
N. Yet, the CFinder community definition is based on cliques instead of maximal cliques, which
can be identified in polynomial time [49]. If, however, there are large cliques in the network, it
is more efficient to identify all cliques using an algorithm with O(eN) complexity [36]. Despite
this high computational complexity, the algorithm is relatively fast, processing the mobile call
network of 4 million mobile phone users in less then one day [50] (see also Image 9.28).

capturing the precise relationship that defines a node’s membership in a community. For
Network Science
example, a link between two individuals may indicate that they are in the same family, or that
by Albert-László Barabási
they work together, or that they share a hobby, designations that only rarely overlap. Similarly,
in biology each binding interaction of a protein is responsible for a different function, uniquely
defining the role of the protein in the cell. This specificity of links has inspired the development
of community finding algorithms that cluster links rather than nodes [51,52].

  

The link clustering algorithm proposed by Ahn, Bagrow and Lehmann [51] consists of the following
steps:

Step 1: Define Link Similarity
The similarity of a link pair is determined by the neighborhood of the nodes connected by them.
Consider for example the links (i,k) and (j,k), connected to the same node k. Their similarity is
defined as (Image 9.23a-c)

∣∣n+
∣∣n+

∣∣
(i)∩ (j)
∣∣
(i)∪ (j)

n+
n+

(9. 17)

S((i, k), (j, k)) =
where n+(i) is the list of the neighbors of node i, including itself. Hence S measures the relative
number of common neighbors i and j have. Consequently S=1 if i and j have the same neighbors
(Image 9.23c). The less is the overlap between the neighborhood of the two links, the smaller is
S (Image 9.23b).

Identifying Link Communities
The link clustering algorithm identiﬁes links with a similar topological role in a network. It does so by
exploring the connectivity patterns of the nodes at the two ends of each link. Inspired by the similarity
function of the Ravasz algorithm [4] (Image 9.19), the algorithm aims to assign to high similarity S the
links that connect to the same group of nodes.
•  The similarity S of the (i,k) and (j,k) links connected to node k detects if the two links belong to the
same group of nodes. Denoting with n+(i) the list of neighbors of node i, including itself, we obtain
|n+(i)∪n+(j)| =12 and |n+(i)∩n+(j)| =4, resulting in S = 1/3 according to (9.17).
•  For an isolated (ki = kj = 1) connected triple we obtain S = 1/3.
•  For a triangle we have S = 1.
•  The link similarity matrix for the network shown in (e) and (f). Darker entries correspond to link pairs

Step 2: Apply Hierarchical Clustering
The similarity matrix S allows us to use hierarchical clustering to identify link communities
(SECTION 9.3). We use a single-linkage procedure, iteratively merging communities with the
largest similarity link pairs (Image 9.10).

Taken together, for the network of Image 9.23e, (9.17) provides the similarity matrix shown in
(d). The single-linkage hierarchical clustering leads to the dendrogram shown in (d), whose cuts
result in the link communities shown in (e) and the overlapping node communities shown in (f).

Image 9.24 illustrates the community structure of the characters of Victor Hugo’s novel Les
Miserables identified using the link clustering algorithm. Anyone familiar with the novel can
convince themselves that the communities accurately represent the role of each character.
Several characters are placed in multiple communities, reflecting their overlapping roles in the
novel. Links, however, are unique to each community.

Computational Complexity
The link clustering algorithm involves two time-limiting steps: similarity calculation and
hierarchical clustering. Calculating the similarity (9.17) for a link pair with degrees ki and kj
requires max(ki,kj) steps. For a scale-free network with degree exponent γ the calculation of
similarity has complexity O(N2/(γ-1)), determined by the size of the largest node, kmax.
Hierarchical clustering requires O(L2) time steps. Hence the algorithm's totalcomputational
complexity is O(N2/(γ-1))+ O(L2). For sparse graphs the latter term dominates, leading to O(N2).

The need to detect overlapping communities have inspired numerous algorithms [53]. For
example, the CFinder algorithm has been extended to the analysis of weighted [54], directed and
bipartite graphs [55,56]. Similarly, one can derive quality functions for link clustering [52], like
the modularity function discussed in SECTION 9.4.

In summary, the algorithms discussed in this section acknowledge the fact that nodes naturally
belong to multiple communities. Therefore by forcing each node into a single community, as we
did in the previous sections, we obtain a misleading characterization of the underlying
community structure. Link communities recognize the fact that each link accurately captures
the nature of the relationship between two nodes. As a bonus link clustering also predicts the
overlapping community structure of a network.

Testing Communities

Community identification algorithms offer a powerful diagnosis tool, allowing us to characterize
the local structure of real networks. Yet, to interpret and use the predicted communities, we
must understand the accuracy of our algorithms. Similarly, the need to diagnose large networks
prompts us to address the computational efficiency of our algorithms. In this section we focus
on the concepts needed to assess the accuracy and the speed of community finding.

Network Science
algorithms embody, the partitions uncovered by them can differ, prompting the question:
by Albert-László Barabási
Which community finding algorithm should we use?

  

To assess the performance of community finding algorithms we need to measure an algorithm’s
accuracy, i.e. its ability to uncover communities in networks whose community structure is
known. We start by discussing two benchmarks, which are networks with predefined community
structure, that we can use to test the accuracy of a community finding algorithm.

Girvan-Newman (GN) Benchmark
The Girvan-Newman benchmark consists of N=128 nodes partitioned into nc=4 communities of
size Nc=32 [9,57]. Each node is connected with probability pint to the Nc–1 nodes in its
community and with probability pext to the 3Nc nodes in the other three communities. The
control parameter

μ =

kext

+kext kint

(9. 18)

captures the density differences within and between communities. We expect community
finding algorithms to perform well for small µ (Image 9.25a), when the probability of connecting
to nodes within the same community exceeds the probability of connecting to nodes in different
communities. The performance of all algorithms should drop for large µ (Image 9.25b), when the
link density within the communities becomes comparable to the link density in the rest of the
network.

agreement between the planted and the detected communities.

small μ we have In≃1 and nc, indicating that the algorithm can easily detect well separated communities,

becomes less pronounced. Consequently the communities are increasingly difﬁcult to identify and In
decreases.
•  For μ=0.50 the Ravasz algorithm misplaces a notable fraction of the nodes, as in this case the
communities are not well separated, making it harder to identify the correct community structure

Note that the Ravasz algorithm generates multiple partitions, hence for each μ we show the partition
with the largest modularity, M. Next to (a) and (c) we show the normalized mutual information
associated with the corresponding partition and the number of detected communities nc. The
normalized mutual information (9.23), developed for non-overlapping communities, can be extended to
overlapping communities as well [59].

The GN benchmark generates a random graph in which all nodes have comparable degree and all

communities have identical size. Yet, the degree distribution of most real networks is fat tailed,
and so is the community size distribution (Image 9.29). Hence an algorithm that performs well
on the GN benchmark may not do well on real networks. To avoid this limitation, the LFR
benchmark (Image 9.26) builds networks for which both the node degrees and the planted
community sizes follow power laws [58].

Having built networks with known community structure, next we need tools to measure the
accuracy of the partition predicted by a particular community finding algorithm. As we do so, we
must keep in mind that the two benchmarks discussed above correspond to a particular
definition of communities. Consequently algorithms based on clique percolation or link
clustering, that embody a different notion of communities, may not fare so well on these.

Measuring Accuracy
To compare the predicted communities with those planted in the benchmark, consider an
arbitrary partition into non-overlapping communities. In each step we randomly choose a node
and record the label of the community it belongs to. The result is a random string of community
labels that follow a p(C) distribution, representing the probability that a randomly selected node
belongs to the community C.

Consider two partitions of the same network, one being the benchmark (ground truth) and the
other the partition predicted by a community finding algorithm. Each partition has its own p(C1)
and p(C2) distribution. The joint distribution, p(C1, C2), is the probability that a randomly chosen
node belongs to community C1 in the first partition and C2 in the second. The similarity of the
two partitions is captured by the normalized mutual information [38]

The numerator of (9.19) is the mutual information I, measuring the information shared by the two
community assignments: I=0 if C1 and C2 are independent of each other; I equals the maximal
value H({p(C1)}) = H({p(C2)}) when the two partitions are identical and is the Shannon entropy.

If all nodes belong to the same community, then we are certain about the next label and H=0, as
we do not gain new information by inspecting the community to which the next node belongs
to. H is maximal if p(C) is the uniform distribution, as in this case we have no idea which
community comes next and each new node provides H bits of new information.

In summary, In=1 if the benchmark and the detected partitions are identical, and In=0 if they are
independent of each other. The utility of In is illustrated in Image 9.25b that shows the accuracy
of the Ravasz algorithm for the Girvan-Newman benchmark. In Image 9.27 we use In to test the
performance of each algorithm against the GN and LFR benchmarks. The results allow us to
draw several conclusions:

•  We have In≃1 for µ < 0.5. Consequently when the link density within communities is high

compared to their surroundings, most algorithms accurately identify the planted communities.
Beyond µ=0.5 the accuracy of each algorithm drops.
•  The accuracy is benchmarks dependent. For the more realistic LFR benchmark the Louvain

Speed

As discussed in SECTION 9.2, the number of possible partitions increases faster than
exponentially with N, becoming astronomically high for most real networks. While community
identification algorithms do not check all partitions, their computational cost still varies widely,
determining their speed and consequently the size of the network they can handle. Table 9.1
summarizes the computational complexity of the algorithms discussed in this chapter.
Accordingly, the most efficient are the Louvain and the Infomap algorithms, both of which scale
as 0(NlogN). The least efficient is CFinder with 0(eN).

Algorithmic Complexity
The computational complexity of the community identification algorithms discussed in this
chapter. While computational complexity depends on both N and L, for sparse networks with
good approximation we have L~N. We therefore list computational complexity in terms of N
only.
These scaling laws do not capture the actual running time, however. They only show how the
running time scales with N. This scaling matters if we need to find communities in very large
networks. To get a sense of the true speed of these algorithms we measured their running time
for the protein interaction network (N=2,018), the power grid (N=4,941) and the scientific
collaboration network (N=23,133), using the same computer. The results, shown in Image 9.28,
indicate that:

•  The Louvain method requires the shortest running time for all networks. CFinder is just as
fast for the mid-size networks, and its running time is comparable to the other algorithms for
the larger collaboration network.
•  The Girvan-Newman algorithm is the slowest on each network, in line with its predicted high
computational complexity (Table 9.1). For example the algorithm failed to find communities in
the scientific collaboration network in seven days.

In summary, benchmarks allow us to compare the accuracy and the speed of the available

To compare the speed of community detection algorithms we used their python implementation, either
relying on the versions published by their developers or the available implementation in the igraph

larger running time than ideally possible. We ran each algorithm on the same computer. The plots
provide their running time in seconds for three real networks. For the science collaboration network the
Newman-Girvan algorithm did not ﬁnish after seven days, hence we only provide the lower limit of its
running time. The higher running time observed for the scientiﬁc collaboration network is rooted in the

According to the fundamental hypothesis (H1) the number and the size of communities in a
network are uniquely determined by the network’s wiring diagram. We must therefore ask:
What is the size distribution of these communities?

Many studies report fat tailed community size distributions, implying that numerous small
communities coexist with a few very large ones [16,33,35,36,60]. To explore how widespread this
pattern is, in Figure 9.29 we show pNc for three networks, as predicted by various community
finding algorithms. The plots indicate several patterns:

•  For the protein interaction and the science collaboration network all algorithms predict an
approximately fat tailed pNc. Hence in these networks numerous tiny communities coexist with
a few large communities.
•  For the power grid different algorithms lead to distinct outcomes. Modularity-based

algorithms predict communities with comparable size Nc ≃ 102. In contrast, the Ravasz
algorithm and Infomap predict numerous communities with size Nc ≃ 10 and a few larger

communities. Finally, clique percolation and link clustering predict an approximately fat tailed
community size distribution.

These differences suggest that the fat tailed community size distribution is not a byproduct of a
particular algorithm. Rather it is an inherent property of some networks, like the protein and
the scientific collaboration network. The different outcomes for the power grid suggests that
this network lacks a unique and detectable community structure.

Communities and Link Weights

Link weights are deeply correlated with the community structure. Yet, as we discuss next, the
nature of these correlations is system dependent.

The more time two individuals spend together, the more likely that they share friends, which
Network Science
increases the chance that they belong to the same community. Consequently communities in
by Albert-László Barabási
social networks tend to be nucleated around strong ties. Links connecting different
communities are weaker in comparison. This pattern, known as the weak tie hypothesis [62], is
illustrated in Image 9.30a for the mobile call network [63]. We observe that strong ties are
indeed predominantly within the numerous small communities, and links connecting
communities are visibly weaker.

  

Transport Systems
The purpose of many technological and biological networks is to transport materials or
information. In this case the link weights are expected to correlate with betweenness centrality
[64,65,66], a proxy of the local traffic carried by a network. As links connecting different
communities must transport considerable amount of traffic, in transport networks strong ties
are between communities. In contrast links within communities are weaker in comparison
(Image 9.30b).

The coupling between link weights and community structure suggests that incorporating the
link weights could enhance the accuracy of community finding algorithms. Yet, the different
nature of the coupling in social and technological systems serves as a cautionary note:
Algorithms that aim to place in the same community nodes connected by strong ties may be
only effective in social systems. They may offer potentially misleading results in technological
and biological systems, where strong ties connect different communities.

Communities and Link Weights
The mobile call network helps us illustrate the relationship between link weights and communities. Links
represent mutual calls between the users. We show only nodes that are at distance six or less from the
individual highlighted as a black circle in (a).
•  Real Weights
The link colors capture the aggregate call duration in minutes (see color bar). In line with the weak tie
hypothesis we ﬁnd strong ties mainly within communities and weak ties between communities [62].
•  Betweenness Centrality
If the link weights are driven by the need to transport information or materials, as it is often the case in
technological and biological systems, the weights are well approximated by betweenness centrality
(Image 9.11). We colored the links based on each link’s betweenness centrality. As the ﬁgure indicates,
links connecting communities have high betweenness (red), whereas the links within communities have
low betweenness (green).

Community Evolution

Changes in a network’s wiring diagram can have multiple consequences for communities: they
can lead to the birth of new communities, the growth or the contraction of the existing
communities, communities can merge with each other or split into several smaller
communities, and finally communities can die (Image 9.31) [50]. Studies focusing on social and
communication networks offer several insights into the changes communities experience
[50,67-73]:

Growth
The probability that a node joins a community grows with the number of links the node has to
members of that community [73].

Contraction
Nodes with only a few links to members of their community are more likely to leave the
community than nodes with multiple links to community members [73]. In weighted networks
the probability that a node leaves a community increases with the sum of its link weights to
nodes outside the community.

Splitting or Death
The probability that a community disintegrates increases with the aggregate link weights to
nodes outside the community.

Age
There is positive correlation between the age of a community and its size, indicating that older
communities tend to be larger [50].

Summary

The ubiquity of communities across different networks has turned community identification
into a dynamically developing chapter of network science. Many of the developed algorithms are
now available as software packages, allowing their immediate use for network diagnosis. Yet,
the efficient use of these algorithms and the interpretation of their predictions requires us to be
aware of the assumptions built into them. In this chapter we provided the intellectual and the
quantitative foundations of community detection, helping us understand the origin and the

At a Glance: Communities

  

Community identification rests on several hypotheses, pertaining to the nature of
communities:

Fundamental Hypothesis
Communities are uniquely encoded in a network’s wiring diagram. They represent a grand
truth that remains to be discovered using appropriate algorithms.

Connectedness and Density Hypothesis
A community corresponds to a locally dense connected subgraph.

Random Hypothesis
Randomly wired networks do not have communities.

Maximal Modularity Hypothesis
The partition with the maximum modularity offers the best community structure, where
modularity is given by

M =

lc
L

( )kc

2L

]

nc
∑
c=1

Despite the successes of community identification, the field is faced with numerous open
questions:

Do We Really Have Communities?
Throughout this chapter we avoided a fundamental question: How do we know that there are
indeed communities in a particular network? In other words, could we decide that a network has
communities without first identifying the communities themselves? The lack of an answer to
this question represents perhaps the most glaring gap of the community finding literature.
Community finding algorithms are designed to identify communities, whether they are there or
not.

Hypotheses or Theorems?
Community identification relies on four hypotheses, summarized in BOX 9.3. We call them
hypotheses because we can not prove their correctness. Further advances might be able to turn
the Fundamental, the Random and the Maximal Modularity Hypotheses into theorems. Or we
may learn about their limitations, as we did in the case of the Maximal Modularity Hypothesis

Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
Must all Nodes Belong to Communities?
Community detection algorithm force all nodes into communities. This is likely an overkill for
most real networks: some nodes belong to a single community, others to multiple communities,
and likely many nodes do not belong to any community. Most algorithms used in community
identification do not make this distinction, forcing instead all nodes into some community.

  

Dense vs. Sparse Communities
Most networks explored in this book are sparse. Yet, with improvements in data collection,
many real network maps will likely gain numerous links. In dense networks we often see
numerous highly overlapping communities, forcing us to reevaluate the validity of the various
hypotheses, and the appropriateness of the community detection algorithms discussed in this
chapter. For example, in highly overlapping communities nodes may have higher external than
internal degrees, limiting the validity of the density hypothesis.

Do Communities Matter?
We resort to an example to answer this question. Image 9.32a shows a local neighborhood of the
mobile call network, highlighting four communities identified by the link clustering algorithm
(SECTION 9.5). The figure also shows the call frequency at noon (b) and at midnight (c),
documenting different calling habits at different parts of the day. We find that the members of
the top right community, shown as brown nodes in (a), are active at midnight (b), but they stop
calling each other at noon (c). In contrast the light and the dark blue communities are active at
noon, but are sleepy at midnight. This indicates that communities, identified only from the
network’s wiring diagram, have coherent community-specific activity patterns.

Image 9.32 suggests that once present, communities have a profound impact on network
Network Science
behavior. Numerous measurements support this conclusion: Information travels fast within a
by Albert-László Barabási
community but has difficulty reaching other communities [63]; communities influence the link
weights [62]; the presence of communities can lead to degree correlations [74].

  

Communities are equally remarkable for their potential applications. For example,
strengthening the links between clients that belong to the same community on the WWW can
improve the performance of Webbased services [75]. In marketing, community finding can be
used to identify customers with similar interests or purchasing habits, helping design efficient
product recommendation systems [76]. Communities are often used to create data structures
that can handle queries in a timely fashion [77,78]. Finally, community finding algorithms run
behind many social networks sites, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, helping these services
discover potential friends, posts of interests and target advertising.

While community finding has deep roots in social and computer science, it is a relatively young
chapter of network science (BOX 9.4). As such, our understanding of community organization
continues to develop rapidly, offering increasingly accurate tools to diagnose the local structure
of large networks.

Empirical Results
Image 9.36 shows the C(k) function for the ten reference networks. We also show C(k) for each
network after we applied degree-preserving randomization (green symbols), allowing us to
make several observations:

• For small k all networks have an order of magnitude higher C(k) than their randomized
counterpart. Therefore the small degree nodes are located in much denser neighborhoods than
expected by chance.
• For the scientific collaboration, metabolic, and citation networks with a good approximation
we have C(k)~k–1, while the randomized C(k) is flat. Hence these networks display the
hierarchical modularity of the model of Image 9.13.
• For the Internet, mobile phone calls, actors, email, protein interactions and the WWW C(k)
decreases with k, while their randomized C(k) is k-independent. Hence while these networks
display a hierarchical modularity, the observed C(k) is not captured by our simple hierarchical
model. To fit the C(k) of these systems we need to build models that accurately capture their

Fast Algorithms for Community Detection

The algorithms discussed in this chapter were chosen to illustrate the fundamental ideas and
concepts pertaining to community detection. Consequently they are not guaranteed to be
neither the fastest nor the most accurate algorithms. Recently two algorithms, called the
Louvain algorithm and Infomap have gained popularity, as their accuracy is comparable to the
accuracy of the algorithms covered in this chapter but offer better scalability. Consequently we
can use them to identify communities in very large networks.

There are many similarities between the two algorithms:

• They both aim to optimize a quality function Q . For the Louvain algorithm Q is modularity, M,
and for Infomap Q is an entropy-based measure called the map equation or L.
• Both algorithms use the same optimization procedure.

Given these similarities, we discuss the algorithms together.

The Louvain Algorithm

The O(N2) computational complexity of the greedy algorithm can be prohibitive for very large
networks. A modularity optimization algorithm with better scalability was proposed by Blondel
and collaborators [2]. The Louvain algorithm consists of two steps that are repeated iteratively
(Image 9.37):

Step I
Start with a weighted network of N nodes, initially assigning each node to a different
community. For each node i we evaluate the gain in modularity if we place node i in the
community of one of its neighbors j. We then move node i in the community for which the
modularity gain is the largest, but only if this gain is positive. If no positive gain is found, i stays
in its original community. This process is applied to all nodes until no further improvement can
be achieved, completing Step I.

The modularity change ΔM obtained by moving an isolated node i into a community C can be
calculated using

the sum of the weights of all links in the network.

Note that ΔM is a special case of (9.13), which provides the change in modularity after merging
communities A and B. In the current case B is an isolated node. We can use ΔM to determine the
modularity change when i is removed from the community it belonged earlier. For this we
calculate ΔM for merging i with the community C after we excluded i from it. The change after
removing i is –ΔM.

Step II
We construct a new network whose nodes are the communities identified during Step I. The
weight of the link between two nodes is the sum of the weight of the links between the nodes in
the corresponding communities. Links between nodes of the same community lead to weighted
self-loops.

Once Step II is completed, we repeat Steps I - II, calling their combination a pass (Image 9.37).
The number of communities decreases with each pass. The passes are repeated until there are
no more changes and maximum modularity is attained.

The Louvain Algorithm
The main steps of the Louvain algorithm. Each pass consists of two distinct steps:

Step I
Modularity is optimized by local changes. We choose a node and calculate the change in modularity,
(9.58), if the node joins the community of its immediate neighbors. The ﬁgure shows the expected
modularity change ΔMo,i for node 0. Accordingly node 0 will join node 3, as the modularity change for
this move is the largest, being ΔM0,3=0.032. This process is repeated for each node, the node colors
corresponding to the resulting communities, concluding Step I.

Step II
The communities obtained in Step I are aggregated, building a new network of communities. Nodes
belonging to the same community are merged into a single node, as shown on the top right. This
process will generate self-loops, corresponding to links between nodes in the same community that are
now merged into a single node.

The sum of Steps I & II are called a pass. The network obtained after each pass is processed again (Pass
2), until no further increase of modularity is possible. After [2].

Computational Complexity
The Louvain algorithm is more limited by storage demands than by computational time. The

subsequent passes over a decreasing number of nodes and links, the complexity of the

algorithm is at most O(L). It therefore allows us to identify communities in networks with
millions of nodes.

Infomap

Introduced by Martin Rosvall and Carl T Bergstrom, Infomap exploits data compression for
community identification (Image 9.38) [44-46]. It does it by optimizing a quality function for
community detection in directed and weighted networks, called the map equation.

Consider a network partitioned into nc communities. We wish to encode in the most efficient
fashion the trajectory of a random walker on this network. In other words, we want to describe
the trojectory with the smallest number of symbols. The ideal code should take advantage of the
fact that the random walker tends to get trapped into communities, staying there for a long time
(Image 9.38c).

To achieve this coding we assign:

• One code to each community (index codebook). For example the purple community in Image
9.38c is assigned the code 111.
• Codewords for each node within each community. For example the top left node in (c) is
assigned 001. Note that the same node code can be reused in different communities.
• Exit codes that mark when the walker leaves a community, like 0001 for the purple
community in (c).

Image 9.38
From Data Compression to Communities
Infomap detect communities by compressing the movement of a random walker on a network.
•  The orange line shows the trajectory of a random walker on a small network. We want to describe this
trajectory with a minimal number of symbols, which we can achieve by assigning repeatedly used
structures (communities) short and unique names.

•  We start by giving a unique name to each node. This is derived using a Huffman coding, a data
Network Science
compression algorithm that assigns each node a code using the estimated probability that the random
by Albert-László Barabási
walk visits that node. The 314 bits under the network describe the sample trajectory of the random
walker shown in (a), starting with 1111100 for the ﬁrst node of the walk in the upper left corner, 1100 for
the second node, etc., and ending with 00011 for the last node on the walk in the lower right corner.
•  The ﬁgure shows a two-level encoding of the random walk, in which each community receives a
unique name, but the name of nodes within communities are reused. This code yields on average a 32%
shorter coding. The codes naming the communities and the codes used to indicate an exit from each
community are shown to the left and the right of the arrows under the network, respectively. Using this
code, we can describe the walk in (a) by the 243 bits shown under the network in (c). The ﬁrst three bits
111 indicate that the walk begins in the red community, the code 0000 speciﬁes the ﬁrst node of the
walk, etc.
•  By reporting only the community names, and not the locations of each node within the communities,
we obtain an efﬁcient coarse graining of the network, which corresponds to its community structure.

The goal, therefore, is to build a code that offers the shortest description of the random walk.
Once we have this code, we can identify the network's community structure by reading the
index codebook, which is uniquely assigned to each community (Image 9.38c).

The optimal code is obtained by finding the minimum of the map equation

L = qH(Q) +

H(

⊙ Pc

)

(9. 57)

nc

c=1

In a nutshell, the first term of (9.59) gives the average number of bits necessary to describe the
movement between communities where q is the probability that the random walker switches
communities during a given step.

The second term gives the average number of bits necessary to describe movement within
communities. Here H(Pc) is the entropy of within-community movements — including an “exit
code” to capture the departure from a community i.

The specific terms of the maps equation and their calculation in terms of the probabilities
capturing the movement of a random walker on a network, is somewhat involved. They are
described in detail in Ref [44-46]. Online Resource 9.3 offers an interactive tool to illustrate the
mechanism behind (9.59) and its use.

At the end L serves as a quality function, that takes up a specific value for a particular partition
of the network into communities. To find the best partition, we must minimize L over all
possible partitions. The popular implementation of this optimization procedure follows Steps I
and II of the Louvain algorithm: We assign each node to a separate community, and we
systematically join neighboring nodes into modules if the move decreases L. After each move L
is updated using (9.59). The obtained communities are joined into supercommunities, finishing
a pass, after which the algorithm is restarted on the new, reduced network.

Computational Complexity
The computational complexity of Infomap is determined by the procedure used to minimize the
map equation L. If we use the Louvain procedure, the computational complexity is the same as
that of the Louvain algorithm, i.e. at most O(LlogL) or O(NlogN) for a sparse graph.

In summary, the Louvain algorithm and Infomap offer tools for fast community identification.
Their accuracy across benchmarks is comparable to the accuracy of the algorithms discussed
throughout this chapter (Image 9.28).

Threshold for clique percolation

In this section we derive the percolation threshold (9.20) for clique percolation on a random
network and discuss the main steps of the CFinder algorithm (Image 9.39).

When we roll a k-clique to an adjacent k-clique by relocating one of its nodes, the expectation
value of the number of adjacent k-cliques for the template to roll further should equal exactly
one at the percolation threshold (Image 9.20). Indeed, a smaller than one expectation value will
result in a premature end of the k-clique percolation clusters, because starting from any
k-clique, the rolling would quickly come to a halt. Consequently the size of the clusters would
decay exponentially. A larger than one expectation value, on the other hand, allows the clique
community to grow indefinitely, guaranteeing that we have a giant cluster in the system.

The above expectation value is provided by

Introduction

On the night of February 21, 2003 a physician from Guangdong Province in southern China
checked into the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. He previously treated patients suffering from a
disease that, lacking a clear diagnosis, was called atypical pneumonia. Next day, after leaving the
hotel, he went to the local hospital, this time as a patient. He died there several days later of
atypical pneumonia [1].

The physician did not leave the hotel without a trace: That night sixteen other guests of the
Metropole Hotel and one visitor also contracted the disease that was eventually renamed Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. These guests carried the SARS virus with them to Hanoi,
Singapore, and Toronto, sparking outbreaks in each of those cities. Epidemiologists later traced
close to half of the 8,100 documented cases of SARS back to the Metropole Hotel. With that the
physician who brought the virus to Hong Kong become an example of a super-spreader, an
individual who is responsible for a disproportionate number of infections during an epidemic.

A network theorist will recognize super-spreaders as hubs, nodes with an exceptional number of
links in the contact network on which a disease spreads. As hubs appear in many networks,
super-spreaders have been documented in many infectious diseases, from smallpox to AIDS [2].
In this chapter we introduce a network based approach to epidemic phenomena that allows us to
understand and predict the true impact of these hubs. The resulting framework, that we call
network epidemics, offers an analytical and numerical platform to quantify and forecast the
spread of infectious diseases.

Super-spreaders
One-hundred-forty-four of the 206 SARS patients diagnosed in Singapore were traced to a chain of ﬁve
individuals that included four super-spreaders. The most important of these was Patient Zero, the
physician from Guangdong Province in China, who brought the disease to the Metropole Hotel. After [1].

Infectious diseases account for 43% of the global burden of disease, as captured by the number of
years of lost healthy life. They are called contagious, as they are transmitted by contact with an ill
person or with their secretions. Cures and vaccines are rarely sufficient to stop an infectious
disease - it is equally important to understand how the pathogen responsible for the disease
spreads in the population, which in turn determines the way we administer the available cures
or vaccines.

The diversity of phenomena regularly described as spreading processes on networks is
staggering:

Digital
A computer virus is a self-reproducing program that can transmit a copy of itself from computer
to computer. Its spreading pattern has many similarities to the spread of pathogens. But digital
viruses also have many unique features, determined by the technology behind the specific virus.
As mobile phones morphed into hand-held computers, lately we also witnessed the appearance
of mobile viruses and worms that infect smartphones (Image 10.2).

Image 10.2
Mobile Phone Viruses
Smart phones, capable of sharing programs and data with each other, offer a fertile ground for virus
writers. Indeed, since 2004 hundreds of smart phone viruses have been identiﬁed, reaching a state of
sophistication in a few years that took computer viruses about two decades to achieve [3]. Mobile
viruses are transmitted using two main communication mechanisms [4]:

Bluetooth (BT) Viruses
A BT virus infects all phones found within BT range from the infected phone, which is about 10-30
meters. As physical proximity is essential for a BT connection, the transmission of a BT virus is
determined by the owner’s location and the underlying mobility network, connecting locations by
individuals who travel between them (SECTION 10.4). Hence BT viruses follow a spreading pattern
similar to inﬂuenza.

Viruses carried by MMS can infect all susceptible phones whose number is in the infected phone’s

that is independent of the infected phone’s physical location. Consequently the spreading of MMS
viruses is similar to the patterns characterizing computer viruses.

Social
The role of the social and professional network in the spread and acceptance of innovations,
knowledge, business practices, products, behavior, rumors and memes, is a much-studied
problem in social sciences, marketing and economics [5, 6]. Online environments, like Twitter,
offer unprecedented ability to track such phenomena. Consequently a staggering number of
studies focus on social spreading, asking for example why can some messages reach millions of
individuals, while others struggle to get noticed.

The examples discussed above involve diverse spreading agents, from biological to computer
viruses, ideas and products; they spread on different types of networks, from social to computer
and professional networks; they are characterized by widely different time scales and follow
different mechanisms of transmission (Table 10.1). Despite this diversity, as we show in this
chapter, these spreading processes obey common patterns and can be described using the same
network-based theoretical and modeling framework.

Epidemic Modeling

  

Epidemiology has developed a robust analytical and numerical framework to model the spread
of pathogens. This framework relies on two fundamental hypotheses:

Compartmentalization
Epidemic models classify each individual based on the stage of the disease affecting them. The
simplest classification assumes that an individual can be in one of three states or compartments:

• Susceptible (S): Healthy individuals who have not yet contacted the pathogen (Image 10.3).
• Infectious (I): Contagious individuals who have contacted the pathogen and hence can infect
others.
• Recovered (R): Individuals who have been infected before, but have recovered from the disease,
hence are not infectious.

The modeling of some diseases requires additional states, like immune individuals, who cannot
be infected, or latent individuals, who have been exposed to the disease, but are not yet
contagious.

Individuals can move between compartments. For example, at the beginning of a new influenza
outbreak everyone is in the susceptible state. Once an individual comes into contact with an
infected person, she can become infected. Eventually she will recover and develop immunity,
losing her susceptibility to the the particular strain of influenza.

• 

• 

Homogenous Mixing
The homogenous mixing hypothesis (also called fully mixed or mass-action approximation)
assumes that each individual has the same chance of coming into contact with an infected
individual. This hypothesis eliminates the need to know the precise contact network on which
the disease spreads, replacing it with the assumption that anyone can infect anyone else.

Pathogens
A pathogen, a word rooted in the Greek words “suffering, passion” (pathos) and “producer of” (genes),
denotes an infectious agent or germ. A pathogen could be a disease-causing microorganism, like a
virus, a bacterium, a prion, or a fungus. The ﬁgure shows several much-studied pathogens, like the HIV
virus, responsible for AIDS, an inﬂuenza virus and the hepatitis C virus. After

In this section we introduce the epidemic modeling framework built on these two hypotheses.
To be specific, we explore the dynamics of three frequently used epidemic models, the so-called
SI, SIS and SIR models, that help us understand the basic building blocks of epidemic modeling.

Network Science
(I(0)=0). Let us assume that a typical individual has 〈k〉 contacts and that the likelihood that the
by Albert-László Barabási
disease will be transmitted from an infected to a susceptible individual in a unit time is β. We
ask the following: If a single individual becomes infected at time t=0 (i.e. I(0)=1), how many
individuals will be infected at some later time t?

  

Within the homogenous mixing hypothesis the probability that the infected person encounters
a susceptible individual is S(t)/N. Therefore the infected person comes into contact with 〈k〉S(t)/N
susceptible individuals in a unit time. Since I(t) infected individuals are transmitting the
pathogen, each at rate β, the average number of new infections dI(t) during a timeframe dt is

Consequently I(t) changes at the rate

s(t) = S(t)/N, i(t) = I(t)/N
Throughout this chapter we will use the variables

(10. 1)

 i(t) = I(t)/N

s(t) = S(t)/N,
to capture the fraction of the susceptible and of the infected population at time t. For simplicity
we also drop the (t) variable from i(t) and s(t), re-writing (10.1) as (ADVANCED TOPICS 10.A)

where the product β〈k〉 is called the transmission rate or transmissibility. We solve (10.3) by writing

(10. 3)

ln i − ln(1 − i) + C = β ⟨k⟩ t
With the initial condition i0= i(t=0), we get C=i0/(1–i0), obtaining that the fraction of infected
individuals increases in time as

Equation (10.4) predicts that:

•  At the beginning the fraction of infected individuals increases exponentially (Image 10.4b).
Indeed, early on an infected individual encounters only susceptible individuals, hence the
pathogen can easily spread.
•  The characteristic time required to reach an 1/e fraction (about 36%) of all susceptible
individuals is

Hence τ is the inverse of the speed with which the pathogen spreads through the population.
Equation (10.5) predicts that increasing either the density of links〈k〉 or β enhances the speed of
the pathogen and reduces the characteristic time.
•  With time an infected individual encounters fewer and fewer susceptible individuals. Hence
the growth of i slows for large t (Image 10.4b). The epidemic ends when everyone has been
infected, i.e. when i(t→∞)=1 and s(t→∞)=0.

The Susceptible-Infected (SI) Model
•  In the SI model an individual can be in one of two states: susceptible (healthy) or infected (sick). The
model assumes that if a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infected individual, it
becomes infected at rate β. The arrow indicates that once an individual becomes infected, it stays
infected, hence it cannot recover.
•  Time evolution of the fraction of infected individuals, as predicted by (10.4). At early times the fraction
of infected individuals grows exponentially. As eventually everyone becomes infected, at large times we
have i(∞)=1.

Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) Model

Most pathogens are eventually defeated by the immune system or by treatment. To capture this
fact we need to allow the infected individuals to recover, ceasing to spread the disease. With that
we arrive at the so-called SIS model, which has the same two states as the SI model, susceptible
and infected. The difference is that now infected individuals recover at a fixed rate µ, becoming
susceptible again (Image 10.5a). The equation describing the dynamics of this model is an
extension of (10.3),

= β ⟨k⟩ i(1 − i) − μi

where µ is the recovery rate and the µi term captures the rate at which the population recovers
from the disease. The solution of (10.6) provides the fraction of infected individuals in function

The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) Model
•  The SIS model has the same states as the SI model: susceptible and infected. It differs from the SI
model in that it allows recovery, i.e. infected individuals are cured, becoming susceptible again at rate μ.
•  Time evolution of the fraction of infected individuals in the SIS model, as predicted by (10.7). As
recovery is possible, at large t the system reaches an endemic state, in which the fraction of infected
individuals is constant, i(∞), given by (10.8). Hence in the endemic state only a ﬁnite fraction of
individuals are infected. Note that for high recovery rate μ the number of infected individuals decreases
exponentially and the disease dies out.

  

While in the SI model eventually everyone becomes infected, (10.7) predicts that in the SIS
model the epidemic has two possible outcomes:

•  Endemic State (µ < β〈k〉)
For low recovery rate the fraction of infected individuals, i, follows a logistic curve similar to the
one observed for the SI model. Yet, not everyone is infected, but i reaches a constant i(∞) < 1
value (Image 10.5b). This means that at any moment only a finite fraction of the population is
infected. In this stationary or endemic state the number of newly infected individuals equals the
number of individuals who recover from the disease, hence the infected fraction of the
population does not change with time. We can calculate i(∞) by setting di/dt=0 in (10.6),
obtaining
i(∞) = 1 −
•  Disease-free State (µ > β〈k〉)
For a sufficiently high recovery rate the exponent in (10.7) is negative. Therefore, i decreases
exponentially with time, indicating that an initial infection will die out exponentially. This is
because in this state the number of individuals cured per unit time exceeds the number of newly
infected individuals. Therefore with time the pathogen disappears from the population.

In other words, the SIS model predicts that some pathogens will persist in the population while
others die out shortly. To understand what governs the difference between these two outcomes

circumstances. The basic reproductive number is valuable for its predictive power:

Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
For many pathogens, like most strains of influenza, individuals develop immunity after they
recover from the infection. Hence, instead of returning to the susceptible state, they are
“removed” from the population. These recovered individuals do not count any longer from the
perspective of the pathogen as they cannot be infected, nor can they infect others. The SIR
model, whose properties are discussed in Image10.6</a>, captures the dynamics of this process.

The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model
by Albert-László Barabási
•  In contrast with the SIS model, in the SIR model recovered individuals enter a recovered state,
meaning that they develop immunity rather than becoming susceptible again. Flu, SARS and Plague are
diseases with this property, hence we must use the SIR model to describe their spread.
•  The differential equations governing the time evolution of the fraction of individuals in the
susceptible s, infected i and the removed r state.
•  The time dependent behavior of s, i and r as predicted by the equations shown in (b). According to
the model all individuals transition from a susceptible (healthy) state to the infected (sick) state and
then to the recovered (immune) state.

  

In summary, depending on the characteristics of a pathogen, we need different models to
capture the dynamics of an epidemic outbreak. As shown in Image 10.7, the predictions of the
SI, SIS, and SIR models agree with each other in the early stages of an epidemic: When the
number of infected individuals is small, the disease spreads freely and the number of infected
individuals increases exponentially. The outcomes are different for large times: In the SI model
everyone becomes infected; the SIS model either reaches an endemic state, in which a finite
fraction of individuals are always infected, or the infection dies out; in the SIR model everyone
recovers at the end. The reproductive number predicts the long-term fate of an epidemic: for R0
< 1 the pathogen persists in the population, while for R0 > 1 it dies out naturally.

The models discussed so far have ignored the fact that that an individual comes into contact
only with its network-based neighbors in the pertinent contact network. We assumed
homogenous mixing instead, which means that an infected individual can infect any other
individual. It also means that an infected individual typically infects only 〈k〉 other individuals,
ignoring variations in node degrees. To accurately predict the dynamics of an epidemic, we need
to consider the precise role the contact network plays in epidemic phenomena.

The ease of air travel, allowing millions to cross continents on a daily basis, has dramatically
accelerated the speed with which pathogens travel around the world. While in medieval times a
virus took years to sweep a continent (Image 10.8), today a new virus can reach several
continents in a matter of days. There is an acute need, therefore, to understand and predict the
precise patterns that pathogens follow as they spread around the globe.

Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
The epidemic models discussed in the previous section do not incorporate the structure of the
contract network that facilitates the spread of a pathogen. Instead they assume that any
individual can come into contact with any other individual (homogenous mixing hypothesis)
and that all individuals have comparable number of contacts, 〈k〉. Both assumptions are false:
Individual can transmit a pathogen only to those they come into contact with, hence pathogens
spread on a complex contact network. Furthermore, these contact networks are often scale-
free, hence 〈k〉 is not sufficient to characterize their topology.

  

The failure of the basic hypotheses prompted a fundamental revision of the epidemic modeling
framework. This change began with the work of Romualdo Pastor-Satorras and Alessandro
Vespignani, who in 2001 extended the basic epidemic models to incorporate in a self-consistent
fashion the topological characteristics of the underlying contact network [9]. In this section we
introduce the formalism developed by them, familiarizing ourselves with network epidemics.

Susceptible-Infected (SI) Model on a Network

If a pathogen spreads on a network, individuals with more links are more likely to be in contact
with an infected individual, hence they are more likely to be infected. Therefore the
mathematical formalism must consider the degree of each node as an implicit variable. This is
achieved by the degree block approximation, that distinguishes nodes based on their degree and
assumes that nodes with the same degree are statistically equivalent (Image 10.9). Therefore we
denote with

Ik
Nk

=

(10. 11)

ik
the fraction of nodes with degree k that are infected among all Nk degree-k nodes in the
network. The total fraction of infected nodes is the sum of all infected degree-k nodes

(10. 12)

Given the different node degrees, we write the SI model for each degree k/ separately:

This equation has the same structure as (10.3): The infection rate is proportional to β and the
fraction of degree-k nodes that are not yet infected, which is (1-ik). Yet, there are some key
differences:

•  The average degree 〈k〉 in (10.3) is replaced with each node’s actual degree k.
•  The density function Θk represents the fraction of infected neighbors of a susceptible node k.
In the homogenous mixing assumption Θk is simply the fraction of the infected nodes, i. In a

Degree Block Approximation
The epidemic models discussed in SECTION 10.2 grouped each node into compartments based on their
state, placing them into susceptible, infected, or recovered compartments. To account for the role of the
network topology, the degree block approximation adds an additional set of compartments, placing all
nodes that have the same degree into the same block. In other words, we assume that nodes with the
same degree behave similarly. This allows us to write a separate rate equation for each degree, as we
did in (10.13). The degree block approximation does not eliminate the compartments based on the state
of an individual: Independent of its degree an individual can be susceptible to the disease (empty
circles) or infected (full circles).

We start by exploring the early time behavior of ik, a choice driven by both theoretical interest
and practical considerations. Indeed, developing vaccines, cures, and other medical
interventions for a new pathogen can take months to years. If we lack a cure, the only way to
alter the course of an epidemic is to do so early, using quarantine, travel restrictions and
transmission-slowing measures to halt its spread. To make the right decision about the nature,
the timing and the magnitude of each intervention, we need an accurate estimate of the number

Scale-free Network with γ≥3
Network Science
If the contract network on which the disease spreads is scale-free with degree exponent γ ≥3,
by Albert-László Barabási
both 〈k〉 and 〈k2〉 are finite. Consequently τSI is also finite and the spreading dynamics is similar
to the behavior predicted for a random network but with an altered τSI.

  

Scale-free Networks with γ≤3
For γ < 3 in the N→∞ limit 〈k2〉→∞ hence (10.16) predicts τSI→0. In other words, the spread of a
pathogen on a scale-free network is instantaneous. This is perhaps the most unexpected prediction
of network epidemics.

The vanishing characteristic time reflects the important role hubs play in epidemic phenomena.
Indeed, as illustrated in Image 10.10, in a scale-free network the hubs are the first to be
infected, as through the many links they have, they are very likely to be in contact with an
infected node. Once a hub becomes infected, it “broadcasts” the disease to the rest of the
network, turning into a super-spreader.

• 

• 

Inhomogenous Networks
A network does not need to be strictly scale-free for the impact of the degree heterogeneity to
be detectable. Indeed, (10.16) predicts that as long as 〈k2〉 > 〈k〉(〈k〉+1), τSI is reduced. Hence
heterogenous network enhance the speed of any pathogen.

Fraction of Infected Nodes in the SI Model
Equation (10.17) predicts that the a pathogen spreads with different speed on nodes with different
degrees. To be speciﬁc, we can write ik=g(t)+kf(t), indicating that at any time the fraction of high degree
nodes that are infected is higher than the fraction of low degree nodes. The ﬁgure shows the fraction of
infected nodes with degrees k=1, 10 and 100 in an Erdős-Rényi network with average degree 〈k〉=2. It
shows that at t=3 less than 3% of the k=1 nodes are infected, in contrast with close to 20% of the k=10
nodes and close to 30% of the k=20 nodes. Consequently, at any time virtually all hubs are infected, but
small-degree nodes tend to be disease free. Hence the disease is maintained in the hubs, which in turn
broadcast the disease to the rest of the network.

In the SI model with time the pathogen reaches all individuals. Consequently the degree
heterogeneity affects only the characteric time, which in turn determines the speed with which
the pathogen sweeps through the population. To understand the full impact of the network
topology, we need to explore the behavior of the SIS model on a network.

Yet, the number of infected individuals does not increase gradually with λ. Rather, the pathogen
can spread only if its spreading rate exceeds an epidemic threshold λc. Next we calculate λc for
random and scale-free networks.

As 〈k〉 is always finite, a random network always has a nonzero epidemic threshold (Image 10.11),
with key consequences:
•  If the spreading rate λ exceeds the epidemic threshold λc, the pathogen will spread until it
reaches an endemic state, where a finite fraction i(λ) of the population is infected at any time.
•  If λ < λc, the pathogen dies out, i.e. i(λ)=0.

Hence the epidemic threshold allows us to decide if a pathogen can or cannot persist in a
population. This transition from the absence to the presence of an epidemic outbreak by
increasing the spreading rate λ is at the basis of most campaigns to stop a pathogen (SECTION

i(λc)=0. If, however, the spreading rate of the pathogen exceeds λc, the pathogen becomes endemic
and a ﬁnite fraction of the population is infected at any time. For a scale-free network we have λc=0,
hence even viruses with a very small spreading rate λ can persist in the population.

epidemic threshold λc, the density function Θ(λ) and i(λ) for a scale-free network with degree exponent
γ. The results indicate that only for γ >4 does the epidemics on a scale-free network converge to the
results of the traditional epidemic models. After [10].

The vanishing epidemic threshold is a direct consequence of the hubs. Indeed, a pathogen that
fails to infect other nodes before the infected individual recovers, will slowly disappear from the
population (ADVANCED TOPICS 10.A). In a random network all nodes have comparable degree,
k≈〈k〉, hence if the spreading rate is under the epidemic threshold, the pathogen has no avenues
to spread. In a scale-free network, however, even if a pathogen is only weakly infectious, if it
infects a hub, the hub can pass it on to a large number of other nodes, allowing it to persist in
the population.

In summary, the results of this section show that accounting for the network topology greatly
alters the predictive power of the epidemic models. We derived two fundamental results:

•  In a large scale-free network τ=0, which means that a virus can instantaneously reach most
nodes.
•  In a large scale-free network λc=0, which means that even viruses with small spreading rate
can persist in the population.

Both results are the consequence of hubs’ ability to broadcast a pathogen to a large number of
other nodes.

with high degree heterogeneity. In other words, if 〈k2〉 is larger than the random expectation
〈k〉(〈k+1〉), we will observe an enhanced spreading process, resulting in a smaller τ and λc than
predicted by the traditional epidemic models. As this implies a faster spread of the pathogen
than predicted by the traditional epidemic models, efforts to control an epidemic cannot ignore
this difference.

The results of this section were based on the degree-block approximation, which treats the
detailed time-dependent infection process in a mean-field fashion. Note, however, that this
approximation, while simplifies the presentation, is not necessary. The underlying stochastic
problem can be treated in its full mathematical complexity [11-14]. Such calculations show that
due to the fact that the hubs can be re-infected in the SIS model, the epidemic threshold
vanishes even for γ >3, in contrast with the finite threshold predicted by the mean-field
approach (Image 10.12). Hence hubs play an even more important role than our earlier
calculations indicate.

Section 10.4

Contact Networks

Network epidemics predicts that the speed with which a pathogen spreads depends on the
degree distribution of the relevant contact network. Indeed, we found that 〈k2〉 affects both the
characteristic time τ and the epidemic threshold λc. None of these findings are consequential if
the network on which a pathogen spreads is random - in that case the predictions of network
epidemics are indistinguishable from the predictions of the traditional epidemic models
encountered in SECTION 10.2. In this section we inspect the structure of several contact
networks encountered in epidemic phenomena, offering direct empirical evidence of the
significance of the underlying degree heterogeneities.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases

The HIV virus, the pathogen responsible for AIDS, spreads mainly through sexual intercourse.
Consequently, the relevant contact network captures who had sexual relationship with whom.
The structure of this sex web was first revealed by a study surveying the sexual habits of the
Swedish population [15]. Through interviews and questionnaires, researchers collected
information from 4,781 randomly chosen Swedes of ages 18 to 74. The participants were not
asked to reveal the identity of their sexual partners, but only to estimate the number of sexual
partners they had during their lifetime. Hence the researchers could reconstruct the degree
distribution of the sexual network [16], finding that it is well approximated with a power law
(Image 10.13). This was the first empirical evidence of the relevance of scale-free networks to
the spread of pathogens. The finding was confirmed by data collected in Britain, US and Africa

The scale-free nature of the sexual network indicates that most individuals have relatively few
sexual partners. A few individuals, however, had hundreds of sexual partners during their
lifetime. Consequently the sexual network has a high 〈k2〉, which lowers both τ and λc.

Sexual Hubs

Anecdotal evidence suggests that sexual hubs are real. Take for example Wilt
Chamberlain, a Hall of Fame basketball player in the 1980s, who claimed having sex with
a staggering number of 20,000 partners. “Yes, that’s correct, twenty thousand different
ladies,” he wrote in his autobiography [18]. “At my age, that equals to having sex with 1.2
woman a day, every day, since I was fifteen years old.” Within the AIDS literature the
story of Geetan Dugas, a flight attendant with approximately 250 homosexual partners, is
well documented [19]. He is often called patient zero, whom, given his extensive travel,
became a super-spreader of AIDS within the gay community. Hubs are observed even in
high school romantic networks (Image 10.14).

Global Travel Network
To predict the spread of pathogens, we must know how far infected individuals travel. Our
understanding of individual travel patterns exploded with the use of mobile phones, that offer
direct information about individual mobility [21-24]. In the context of epidemic phenomena,
the most studied mobility data comes from air travel, the mode of transportation that
determines the speed with which a pathogen moves around the globe. Consequently the air
transportation network, that connects airports with direct flights, plays a key role in modeling and
predicting the spread of pathogens [25-27]. As Image 10.15 shows, this network is scale-free
with degree exponent γ=1.8. This low value is possible because there are multiple flights
between two airports, hence the network is not simple. A similar power law distribution is
detected for the link weights, indicating that the number of passengers traveling between two
airports is typically low, but between some airports the traffic can be extraordinary. As we
discuss in SECTION 10.5, these heterogeneities play a key role in the spread of specific
pathogens.

Detecting Networks via RFIDs
A video introducing the RFID technology and their use in mapping social interactions.

RFID are digital badges that detect the proximity of other individuals that wear a badge (Video
10.1). They have been deployed in various environment, capturing for example the interactions
between more than 14, 000 visitors of a Science Gallery over a three month period or between
100 participants of a three-day conference [29]. An RFID-mapped network shown in Image
10.16 captures the interactions between high school students and their teachers during a two-
day period. Several findings stand out:

•  RFID tags detect interactions only with individuals that wear the same badge and face each
other, limiting the number of detected contacts. Consequently the contact networks mapped out
in these studies typically have an exponential degree distribution.
•  The duration of each face-to-face interaction follows a power law distribution over several
orders of magnitude. Therefore most contacts are brief, but there are a few lasting interactions,
documenting bursty temporal pattern [35] with key consequences for the spread of pathogens
(SECTION 10.5).
•  The link weights, which capture the cumulative time two individuals have spent together, also
follow a power law distribution. Therefore individuals spend most of their time with only a few
others, again with important implications on spreading patterns (SECTION 10.5).
•  For most airborne pathogens spatial proximity is sufficient for transmission. For example,
standing next to an infected individual in the elevator may be sufficient to transmit SARS or
H1N1, an interaction not recorded by a RFID tag.

an exceptionally large number of smaller locations, like homes and offices. Therefore, once the
pathogen infects a hub, the disease can rapidly reach many other locations.

Digital Viruses

The study of digital viruses, that infect computers and smart phones, represents an increasingly
important application of epidemic phenomena. As we discuss next, the relevent contact
networks are determined by the spreading mode of the respective digital pathogen.

Computer Viruses
Computer viruses display just as much diversity as biological viruses: depending on the nature
of the virus and its spreading mechanism, the relevant contact network can differ dramatically.
Many computer viruses spread as email attachments. Once a user opens the attachment, the
virus infects the user’s computer and mails a copy of itself to the email addresses found in the
computer. Hence the pertinent contact network is the email network, which, as we discussed in
Table 4.1, is scale-free [58]. Other computer viruses exploit various communication protocols,
spreading on networks that reflect the Internet's pattern of interconnectedness, which is again
scale-free (Table 4.1). Finally, some malware scan IP addresses, spreading on fully connected
networks.

Mobile Phone Viruses
Mobile phone viruses spread via MMS and Bluetooth (Image 10.2). An MMS virus sends a copy of
itself to all phone numbers found in the phone's contact list. Therefore MMS viruses exploit the
social network behind mobile communications. As shown in Table 4.1, the mobile call network is
scale-free with a high degree exponent. Mobile viruses can also spread via Bluetooth, passing a
copy of themselves to all susceptible phones with a BT connection in their physical proximity.
As discussed above, this co-location network is also highly heterogenous [4].

In summary, in the past decade technological advances allowed us to map out the structure of
several networks that support the spread of biological or digital viruses, from sexual to
proximity-based contact networks (see also Online Resource 10.2). Many of these, like the email
network, the internet, or sexual networks, are scale-free. For others, like co-location networks,
the degree distribution may not be fitted with a simple power law, yet show significant degree
heterogeneity with high 〈k2〉. This means that the analytical results obtained in the previous
section are of direct relevance to pathogens spreading on most networks. Consequently the
underlying heterogenous contact networks allow even weakly virulent viruses to easily spread in
the population.

Beyond the Degree Distribution

So far we have kept our models simple: We assumed that pathogens spread on an unweighted
network uniquely defined by its degree distribution. Yet, real networks have a number of
characteristics that are not captured by pk alone, like degree correlations or community
structure. Furthermore, the links are typically weighted and the interactions have a finite
temporal duration. In this section we explore the impact of these properties on the spread of a
pathogen.

Temporal Networks

Most interactions that we perceive as social links are brief and infrequent. As a pathogen can be
only transmitted when there is an actual contact, an accurate modeling framework must also
consider the timing and the duration of each interaction. Ignoring the timing of the interactions
can lead to misleading conclusions [39-41]. For example, the static network of Image 10.17b was
obtained by aggregating the individual interactions shown in Image 10.17a. On the aggregated
network the infection has the same chance of spreading from D to A as from A to D. Yet, by
inspecting the timing of each interaction, we realize that while an infection starting from A can
infect D, an infection that starts at D cannot reach A. Therefore, to accurately predict an
epidemic process we must consider the fact that pathogens spread on temporal networks, a topic
of increasing interest in network science [40-43]. By ignoring the temporality of these contact
patterns, we typically overestimate the speed and the extent of an outbreak [42,43].

the underlying networks as temporal networks, an increasingly active research topic in network science.
•  Temporal Network
The timeline of the interactions between four individuals. Each vertical line marks the moment when two
individuals come into contact with each other. If A is the ﬁrst to be infected, the pathogen can spread
from A to B and then to C, eventually reaching D. If, however, D is the ﬁrst to be infected, the disease can
reach C and B, but not A. This is because there is a temporal path from A to D.
•  Aggregated Network
The network obtained by merging the temporal interactions shown in (a). If we only have access to this
aggregated representation, the pathogen can reach all individuals, independent of its starting point.
After [40].

Bursty Contact Patterns

The theoretical approaches discussed in the SECTIONS 10.2 and 10.3 assume that the timing of
the interactions between two connected nodes is random. This means that the interevent times
between consecutive contacts follow an exponential distribution, resulting in a random but
uniform sequence of events (Image 10.18a-c). The measurements indicate otherwise: The
interevent times in most social systems follow a power law distribution [35,44] (Image 10.18d-f).
This means that the sequence of contacts between two individuals is characterized by periods of
frequent interactions, when multiple contacts follow each other within a relatively short time
frame. Yet, the power law also implies that occasionally there are a very long time gaps between
two contacts. Therefore the contact pattern have an uneven, “bursty” character in time (Image
10.18d,e).

  

Bursty interactions are observed in a number of contact processes of relevance for epidemic
phenomena, from email communications to call patterns and sexual contacts. Once present,
burstiness alters the dynamics of the spreading process [43]. To be specific, power law
interevent times increase the characteristic time τ, consequently the number of infected
individuals decays slower than predicted by a random contact pattern. For example, if the time
between consecutive emails would follow a Poisson distribution, an email virus would decay
following i(t)~exp(–t/τ) with a decay time of τ≈1 day. In the real data, however, the decay time is
τ≈21 days, a much slower process, correctly predicted by the theory if we use power law
interevent times [43].

Degree Correlations

As discussed in CHAPTER 7, many social networks are assortative, implying that high degree
nodes tend to connect to other high degree nodes. Do these degree correlations affect the spread
of a pathogen? The calculations indicate that degree correlations leave key aspects of network
epidemics in place, but they alter the speed with which a pathogen spreads in a network:

•  Degree correlations alter the epidemic threshold λc: assortative correlations decrease λc and
dissasortative correlations increase it [45,46].
•  Despite the changes in λc, for the SIS model the epidemic threshold vanishes for a scale-free
network with diverging second moment, whether the network is assortative, neutral or
disassortative [47]. Hence the fundamental results of SECTION 10.3 are not affected by degree
correlations.
•  Given that hubs are the first to be infected in a network, assortativity accelerates the spread
of a pathogen. In contrast disassortativity slows the spreading process.
•  Finally, in the SIR model assortative correlations were found to lower the prevalence but
increase the average lifetime of an epidemic outbreak [48].

Link Weights and Communities

Throughout this chapter we assumed that all tie strengths are equal, focusing our attention on
pathogens spreading on an unweighted network. In reality tie strengths vary considerably, a
heterogeneity that plays an important role in spreading phenomena. Indeed, the more time an
individual spends with an infected individual, the more likely that she too becomes infected.

In the same vein, previously we ignored the community structure of the network on which the
pathogen spreads. Yet, the existence communities (CHAPTER 9) leads to repeated interactions
between the nodes within the same community, altering the spreading dynamics.

with some key information. At each time step this “infected” individual i passes the
information to her contact j with probability pij~βwij, where β is the spreading probability and wij
is the strength of the ties captured by the number of minutes i and j have spent with each other
on the phone. Indeed, the more time two individuals talk, the higher is the chance that they will
pass on the information. To understand the role of the link weights in the spreading process, we
also consider the situation when the spreading takes place on a control network, that has the
same wiring diagram but all tie strengths are set equal to w=〈wij〉.

As Image 10.19a illustrates, information travels significantly faster on the control network. The
reduced speed observed in the real system indicates that the information is trapped within
communities. Indeed, as we discussed in CHAPTER 9, strong ties tend to be within communities
while weak ties are between them [50]. Therefore, once the information reaches a member of a
community, it can rapidly reach all other members of the same community, given the strong
ties between them. Yet, as the ties between the communities are weak, the information has
difficulty escaping the community. Consequently the rapid invasion of the community is
followed by long intervals during which the infection is trapped within a community. When all
link weights are equal (control), the bridges between communities are strengthened, and the
trapping vanishes.

Complex Contagion

Communities have multiple consequences for spreading, from inducing global cascades [51,52]
to altering the activity of individuals [53].

The diffusion of memes, representing ideas or behavior that spread from individual to
individual, further highlights the important role of communities [54]. Meme diffusion has
attracted considerable attention from marketing [5, 55] to network science [56,57],
communications [58], and social media [59-61]. Pathogens and memes can follow different
spreading patterns, prompting us to systematically distinguish simple from complex contagion
[54,62,63].

Simple contagion is the process we explored so far: It is sufficient to come into contact with an
infected individual to be infected. The spread of memes, products and behavior is often
described by complex contagion, capturing the fact that most individuals do not adopt a new
meme, product or behavioral pattern at the first contact. Rather, adoption requires
reinforcement [64], i.e. repeated contact with several individuals who have already adopted. For
example, the higher is the fraction of a person’s friends that have a mobile phone, the more
likely that she also buys one.

In simple contagion communities trap an information or a pathogen, slowing the spreading
(Image 10.19a). The effect is reversed in complex contagion: Because communities have
redundant ties, they offer social reinforcement, exposing an individual to multiple examples of
adoption. Hence communities can incubate a meme, a product or a behavioral pattern,
enhancing its adoption.

The difference between simple and complex contagion is well captured by Twitter data. Tweets,
or short messages, are often labeled with hashtags, which are keywords acting as memes. Twitter
users can follow other users, receiving their messages; they can forward tweets to their own
followers (retweet), or mention others in tweets. The measurements indicate that most hashtags
are trapped in specific communities, a signature of complex contagion [54]. A high
concentration of a meme within a certain community is evidence of reinforcement. In contrast,
viral memes spread across communities, following a pattern similar to that encountered in
biological pathogens. In general the more communities a meme reaches, the more viral it is

In summary, several network characteristics can affect the spread of a pathogen in a network,
from degree correlations to link weights and the bursty nature of the contact pattern. As we
discussed in this section, some network characteristics slow a pathogen, others aid their spread.
These effects must therefore be accounted for if we wish to predict the spread of a real
pathogen. While these patterns are of obvious relevance for infectious diseases, they also
influence the spread of such non-infectious diseases as obesity (BOX 10.2).

Do Our Friends Make Us Fat?

Infectious diseases, like influenza, SARS, or AIDS, spread through the transmission of a
pathogen. But could the social network aid the spread of noninfectious diseases as well?
Recent measurements indicate that it does, offering evidence that social networks can
impact the spread of obesity, happiness, and behavioral patterns, like giving up smoking
[65,66].

“If your friends are obese, your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher. … If your friend’s friends are
obese, your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher. … If your friend’s friend’s friend, someone you
probably don’t even know, is obese, your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher. It’s only when you
get to your friend’s friend’s friend’s friends that there’s no longer a relationship between that
person’s body size and your own body size.”

Obesity is diagnosed through an individual’s body-mass index (BMI), which is determined
by numerous factors, from genetics to diet and exercise. The measurements show that our
friends also play an important role. The analysis of the social network of 5,209 men and
women has found that if one of our friends is obese, the risk that we too gain weight in
the next two to four years increases by 57% [65]. The risk triples if our best friend is
overweight: In this case, our chances of weight gain jumps by 171% (Image 10.21). For all
practical purposes, obesity appears to be just as contagious as influenza or AIDS, despite
the fact that there is no "obesity pathogen" that transmits it.

proportional to the person's BMI, yellow nodes denoting obese individuals (BMI ≥30). Purple links
are friendship or marital ties and orange links are family ties (e.g. siblings). Clusters of obese and
non-obese individuals are visible in the network. The analysis indicates that these clusters
cannot be attributed to homophily, i.e. the fact that individuals of similar body size may befriend
with each other. They document instead a complex contagion process, capturing the "spread" of
obesity along the links of the social network. After [65].

Immunization

  

Immunization strategies specify how vaccines, treatments or drugs are distributed in the
population. Ideally, should a treatment or vaccine exist, it should be given to every infected
individual or those at risk of contracting the pathogen. Yet, often cost considerations, the
difficulty of reaching all individuals at risk, and real or perceived side effects of the treatment
prohibit full coverage. Given these constraints, immunization strategies aim to minimize the
threat of a pandemic by most effectively distributing the available vaccines or treatments.

Immunization strategies are guided by an important prediction of the traditional epidemic
models: If a pathogen’s spreading rate λ is reduced under its critical threshold λc, the virus
naturally dies out (Image 10.11). Yet, the epidemic threshold vanishes in scale-free networks,
questioning the effectiveness of this strategy. Indeed, if the epidemic threshold vanishes,
immunization strategies can not move λ under λc. In this section we discuss how to use our
understanding of the network topology to design effective network-based immunization
strategies that counter the impact of the vanishing epidemic threshold.

Random Immunization

The main purpose of immunization is to protect the immunized individual from an infection.
Equally important, however, is its secondary role: Immunization reduces the speed with which
the pathogen spreads in a population. To illustrate this effect consider the situation when a
randomly selected g fraction of individuals are immunized in a population [8].

Let us assue that the pathogen follows the SIS model (10.3). The immunized nodes are invisible
to the pathogen, and only the remaining (1–g) fraction of the nodes can contact and spread the
disease. Consequently, the effective degree of each susceptible node changes from 〈k〉 to 〈k〉 (1–
g), which decreases the spreading rate of the pathogen from λ= β/µ to λ'=λ(1–g). Next we explore
the consequences of this reduction in both random and scale-free contact networks.

•  Random Networks
If the pathogen spreads on a random network, for a sufficiently high g the spreading rate λ'
could fall below the epidemic threshold (10.25). The immunization rate gc necessary to achieve
this is calculated by setting

the spreading rate under the epidemic threshold λc. In this case τ becomes negative and the
Network Science
pathogen dies out naturally. This explains why health official encourage a high fraction of the
by Albert-László Barabási
population take the influenza vaccine: The vaccine protects not only the individual, but also the
rest of the population by decreasing the pathogen’s spreading rate. Similarly, a condom not only
protects the individual who uses it from contacting the HIV virus, but also decrease the rate at
which AIDS spreads in the sexual network. Hence for random networks a sufficiently high
immunization rate can eliminate the pathogen from the population.
•  Heterogenous Networks
If the pathogen spreads on a network with high 〈k2〉, and random immunization changes λ to
λ(1–g), we can use (10.26) to determine the critical immunization gc

(10. 29)

For a random network (10.29) reduces to (10.27). For a scale-free network with γ < 3 we have
〈k2〉→∞, hence (10.29) predicts gc →1. In other words if the contact network has a high 〈k2〉, we
need to immunize virtually all nodes to stop the epidemic. This prediction is consistent with the
finding that for many diseases we must immunize 80%-100% of the population to eradicate the
pathogen. For example, measles requires 95% of the population to be immunized [8]; for digital
viruses the strategies relying on random immunization call for close to 100% of the computers
to install the appropriate antivirus software [67].

To illustrate the role degree heterogeneity plays in immunization let us consider a digital virus
spreading on the email network. If we make the email network random and undirected, we have
〈k〉=3.26. Using λ=1 in (10.27) we obtain gc=0.76. In other words, to eradicate the virus we need to
convince 76% of computer users to update their antivirus software. Yet, the email network is
scalefree with 〈k2〉=1,271 (undirected version), hence (10.27) does not apply. In this case (10.29)
predicts gc=0.997 for λ=1, meaning that more that 99.7% of the users must install the software
to halt the email virus. It is virtually impossible to achieve this level of compliance - many users
simply ignore all warnings. This is the reason why email viruses linger for years and disappear
only after the operating systems that supports them is phased out [67].

Box 10.3

How to Halt an Epidemic?

Health safety officials rely on several interventions to control or delay an epidemic
outbreak. Some of the most common interventions include:

Face masks, gloves, and hand washing reduces the transmission rate of airborne or
contact based pathogens. Similarly, condoms reduce the transmission rate of sexually
transmitted pathogens.

  

Contact-Reducing Interventions
For diseases with severe health consequences officials can quarantine patients, close
schools and limit access to frequently visited public spaces, like movie theaters and malls.
These make the network sparser by reducing the number of contacts between individuals,
hence decreasing the transmission rate.

Vaccinations
Vaccinations permanently remove the vaccinated nodes from the network, as they cannot
be infected nor can they spread the disease. Vaccinations also reduce the spreading rate,
enhancing the likelihood that the pathogen dies out.

Vaccination Strategies in Scale-Free Networks

The ineffectiveness of random immunization is rooted in the vanishing epidemic threshold.
Consequently, to successfully eradicate a pathogen in heterogenous networks, we must find
ways to increase the epidemic threshold. This requires us to reduce the variance, 〈k2〉, of the
underlying contact network.

Immunizing the Hubs
Network Science
In heterogenous networks a virus can be eradicated by increasing the epidemic threshold through hub
by Albert-László Barabási
immunization. The ﬁgure shows the expected epidemic threshold if we immunize all nodes with degree
larger than k'max. The more hubs are immunized (i.e. the smaller is k'max), the larger is λc, increasing the
chance that the disease dies out. Immunizing the hubs changes the network on which the disease
spreads, making the hubs invisible to the pathogen (Image 10.23).

  

The hubs are responsible for the large variance of heterogenous networks. Therefore if we
immunize the hubs, i.e. all nodes whose degree exceeds some preselected k'max, we decrease the
variance and increase the epidemic threshold according to (10.26) [68,69]. Indeed, if nodes with
degrees k>k'max are absent, the epidemic threshold changes to (ADVANCED TOPICS 10.C)

λ′c

(10. 30)

Therefore, for γ < 3, the more hubs we cure (i.e. the smaller is k'max), the larger will be the
epidemic threshold (Image 10.22). By immunizing a sufficient fraction of the hubs we can drop
λc below λ= β/µ that characterizes the pathogen. This procedure is equivalent with altering the
underlying network: By immunizing the hubs, we are fragmenting the contact network, making
more difficult for the pathogen to reach the nodes in other components (Image 10.23).

Image 10.23
Robustness and Immunization
Scale-free networks show a remarkable resilience to random node and link failures (CHAPTER 8). At the
same time, they are vulnerable to attacks: If we remove their most connected nodes, scale-free
networks break apart. This phenomena has many similarities to the immunization problem: Random
immunization is unable to eradicate a disease, but selective immunization, that targets the hubs, can

restore a ﬁnite critical threshold, helping us eradicate the disease. The analogy is not accidental: The
Network Science
robustness and the immunization problem can be both linked to the diverging 〈k2〉. Indeed, the
by Albert-László Barabási
vanishing epidemic threshold is equivalent with the ﬁnding that the percolation threshold under random
node removal problem converges to one (ADVANCED TOPICS 10.D). Similarly, the re-emergence of the
epidemic threshold under hub immunization is equivalent with the small percolation threshold
characterizing a scale-free network under attack. Therefore, the attack and targeted immunization
problems represent two sides of the same coin.

  

To illustrate the equivalence between attacks and targeted immunization, consider the network shown
in (a). An attack that removes its ﬁve largest hubs breaks the network into many isolated islands, as
shown in (b). Targeted immunization plays the same role: By making the hubs immune to the disease,
the network on which the pathogen spreads becomes the fragmented network in (b). As the immunized
network is broken into small islands, the pathogen will be stuck in one of the small clusters, unable to
infect the nodes in the other clusters.

Hub immunization represents a perspective change in immunization protocols: instead of trying
to decrease the spreading rate using random immunization, we must alter the topology of the
contact network, which in turn increases λc above the biologically determined λ= β/µ.

The problem with a hub-based immunization strategy is that for most epidemic processes we
lack a detailed map of the contact network. Indeed, we do not know the number of sexual
partners each individual has in a population, nor can we accurately identify the super-spreaders
during an influenza outbreak. In other words it is difficult to identify the hubs. Yet, we can still
exploit the network topology to design more efficient immunization strategies. To do so, we rely
on the friendship paradox, the fact that on average the neighbors of a node have higher degree
than the node itself (BOX 7.1). Therefore, by immunizing the acquaintances of a randomly
selected individual, we target the hubs without having to know precisely which individuals are
hubs. The procedure consists of the following steps [70]:

•  Choose randomly a p fraction of nodes, like we do during random immunization. Call these
nodes Group 0.
•  Select randomly a link for each node in Group 0. We call Group 1 the set of nodes to which
these links connect to. For example, we ask each individual from Group 0 to nominate one of its
acquaintance with whom he/she engaged in an activity that could have resulted in the
transmission of the pathogen. In the case of HIV, ask them to name a sexual partner.
•  Immunize the Group 1 individuals.

Selective Immunization of Scale-free Networks

strategies: random immunization (green) and selective immunization (purple), that immunizes a ﬁrst

This strategy requires no information about the global structure of the network. Yet, according
to (7.3) the probability that a node with k links belongs to Group 1 is proportional to kpk.
Consequently the Group 1 individuals have higher average degree than the Group 0 individuals.
The implications of this bias are illustrated in Image 10.24, which shows the critical threshold

immunization even for high γ, when hubs are less prominent.

smallpox eradication strategy relied on mass vaccination, a strategy that was ineffective
in densely populated areas. Health officials eventually developed network-based
protocols to stop the transmission: They set out to find and treat anyone who had been in
contact with an infected individual. This strategy allowed smallpox to become the first
disease to be officially eradicated (Image 10.25).

  

Eradication is the complete elimination of a pathogen from the population. To select an
infectious disease for eradication, health official must make sure that the targeted
pathogen does not have a non-human reservoir, so human vaccination can truly eradicate
it. There is also need for an efficient and practical vaccine or drug to interrupt its
transmission. So far eradication campaigns had mixed success: smallpox and rinderpest
were successfully eradicated, but programs targeting hookworm, malaria, and yellow
fever have failed.

Section 10.7

Epidemic Prediction

During much of its history humanity has been helpless when faced with a pandemic. Lacking
drugs and vaccines, infectious diseases repeatedly swept through continents, decimating the
world's population. The first vaccine was tested only in 1796 and the systematic development of
vaccines and cures against new pathogens became possible only in the 1990s. Despite the
spectacular medical advances, we have effective vaccines only against a small number of
pathogens. Consequently transmission-reducing and quarantine-based measures remain the
main tools of health professionals in combatting new pathogens. For the combination of
vaccines, treatments and quarantine-based measures to be effective, we need to predict when
and where the pathogen emerges next, allowing local health officials to best deploy their
resources.

The real-time prediction of an epidemic outbreak is a very recent development. The ground was
set by the development of the epidemic modeling framework in the 1980s [72] and by the 2003
SARS epidemic, which resulted in worldwide reporting guidelines about ongoing outbreaks. The
subsequent systematic availability of data pertaining to a pandemic [1] offered real-time input
to modeling efforts. The 2009 H1N1 outbreak was the first beneficiary of these developments,
becoming the first pandemic whose spread was predicted in real time.

The emergence of any new pathogen raises several key questions:

• Where did the pathogen originate?
• Where do we expect new cases?

•  Peak Time
Network Science
Peak time corresponds to the week when most individuals are infected in a particular country.
by Albert-László Barabási
Predicting the peak time helps health officials decide the timing and the quantity of the
vaccines or treatments they distribute. The peak time depends on the arrival time of the first
infection and the demographic and the mobility characteristics of each country. The observed
peak time fell within the prediction interval for 87% of the countries (Image 10.27). In the
remaining cases the difference between the real and the predicted peak was at most two weeks.
•  Early Peak
GLEAM predicted that the H1N1 epidemic will peak out in November, rather than in January or
February, the typical peak time of influenza-like viruses. This unexpected prediction turned out
to be correct, confirming the model’s predictive power. The early peak time was a consequence
of the fact that H1N1 originated in Mexico, rather than South Asia (where many flu viruses come
from), hence it took the virus less time to arrive to the northern hemisphere.
•  The Impact of Vaccination
Several countries implemented vaccination campaigns to accelerate the decline of the
pandemic. The simulations indicated that these mass vaccination campaigns had only negligible
impact on the course of the epidemic. The reason is that the timing of these campaigns was
guided by the expectation of a January peak time, prompting the deployment of the vaccines
after the November 2009 peak [83], too late to have a strong effect.

‘What if’ Analysis

By incorporating the time and nature of each containment and mitigation procedure,
simulations can estimate the efficiency of specific contingency plans [73-75,77,84]. Next we
discuss the impact of two such interventions.

•  Travel Restrictions
Given the important role air travel plays in the spread of a pathogen, faced with a dangerous
pandemic, like an Ebola outbreak (Image 10.28), the first instinct is to restrict travel. Yet, in a
world where key resources travel by air, a travel ban leads to economic collapse. Therefore
before resorting to a travel ban, we must make sure that travel restrictions have beneficial
effects on the pandemic. For this we must realize that awareness of a viral outbreak results in
self-imposed travel reductions. For example, there was a 40% decline in travel to and from
Mexico in May 2009, during the H1N1 outbreak, as individuals canceled non-necessary business
and leisure activities in the infected region. The modeling indicates [80,82] that this 40%
reduction delayed the arrival of the first infection with less than 3 days in various countries
around the world. Furthermore, even if travel dropped 90%, the peak time is delayed with less
than 20 days (Image 10.29).

Most important, travel restrictions do not decrease the number of infected individuals. They
only delay the outbreak, offering local authorities more time to prepare for the pandemic. Hence
travel restrictions are effective only if the delay caused by them increases local vaccination
levels or helps the deployment of cures.

distributed it to their population [86]. The simulations indicate that peak times would have been
delayed with about 3 to 4 weeks, offering time to immunize a larger fraction of the population
before the pandemic reached its peak.

A Night at the Movies

For a fictionalized but plausible depiction of a major pandemic, watch Contagion, the 2011
medical thriller directed by Steven Soderbergh, featuring Marion Cotillard, Bryan
Cranston, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet,
and Jennifer Ehle. The movie follows the desperate attempts of public health officials to
stop a virus and the ensuing panic from sweeping the globe, hence addressing the impact
of both biological and social contagion. The 1995 medical disaster film Outbreak directed
by Wolfgang Petersen, starring Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo and Morgan Freeman,
focuses on a deadly Ebola-like virus that starts from a small village in Zaire and reaches
the United States. Both movies illustrate the difficult choices civilian and military
agencies must take to contain the spread of a deadly pathogen.

Efective Distance

Before cars and airplanes pathogens traveled on foot or at most with the speed of a horse. Hence
a pandemic like the Black Death in Europe moved slowly from village to village (Image 10.8),
following a diffusive process described by simple reaction-diffusion models [87,88]. As the next
infection always emerged in the geographic proximity of the previous infections, there was a
strong correlation between the time of the outbreak and the physical distance from the origin of

the outbreak.
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
Today, with airline travel, physical distance has lost its relevance for epidemic phenomena. A
pathogen that emerges in Manhattan can just as easily travel to London than to Garrison, NY, a
village an our drive from Manhattan. This prompts us to ask: Is there a better space to view the
spread of an epidemic than the physical space? Such space does exist if we replace the
conventional geographic distance with an effective distance derived from the mobility network
[89]. The nodes of the mobility network are cities and the links represent the amount of travel
between them. Each link is directed and weighted, characterized by a flux-fraction 0 ≤ pij ≤ 1,
that represents the fraction of travelers that leave node i and arrive at node j. The values of pij
can be extracted from airline schedules, having pij > 0 only if there is direct travel from i to j.

Given the multiple routes a person can take between any two cities, a pathogen can follow
multiple paths on the mobility network. Yet, its spread is dominated by the most probable
trajectories predicted by the mobility matrix pij. This allows us to define the effective distance dij
between two connected locations i and j, as

) ≥ 0

(10. 31)

= (1 − ln

pij

dij
If pij is small, implying that only a small fraction of individuals that leave from i travel to j, then
the effective distance between i and j is large. Note that dij ≠ dij: For a small village i located near
a metropolis j we expect dij to be small, as most travelers from i go to j. Yet, dij is large as only a
small fraction of travelers leaving the metropolis head to the small village. The logarithm in
(10.31) accounts for the fact that effective distances are additive, whereas probabilities along
multi-step paths are multiplicative.

The Speed of a Pandemic
by Albert-László Barabási
The spread of a pathogen, as predicted by GLEAM, from three initial outbreak locations. While the
geographic spreading pattern is difﬁcult to interpret, in the effective distance representation the
pandemic follows a regular radial pattern (Image 10.31).

  

The observed spreading patterns prompt us to ask: What is the speed of a typical pathogen as it spreads
around the globe? The speed depends on three key parameters:

• The basic reporduction number R0, which is in the vicinity of 2 for inﬂuenza type viruses (Table 10.2).
• The recovery rate, which is approximately 3 days for inﬂuenza.
• The mobility rate, which represents the total fraction of the population that travels during a day. This
parameter is in the range of 0.01-0.001.

Running GLEAM (Image 10.26) with these parameters we can compute the correlation between the
arrival time and the geographic distance to the source of the epidemic, obtaining a speed of about
250-300 km/day. Therefore an inﬂuenza virus moves through a continent with the speed of a sports car
or of a smaller airplane [89].

As Image 10.31 indicates (see also Online Resource 10.6), if we use (10.31) to represent the
distance of each city from the source of an epidemic, the pathogen follows circular wave fronts.
This is in contrast with the complex spreading pattern we observe if we view the pandemic in
the geographical space. Furthermore, while the arrival time of H1N1 appears to be random if
plotted in function of the physical distance, it correlates strongly with the effective distance
(Image 10.32). We can therefore use the effective distance to determine the speed of a pathogen
(Online Resource 10.6).

A surprising but welcome aspect of epidemic forecast is that the predictions of different models
are rather similar, despite the fact that they use different mobility data (airline schedules
[25,26] or dollar bill movement [24]) and different assumptions about the epidemic parameters
(recovery rate, transmission rate, etc). The effective distance helps us understand why the
various model predictions converge. Indeed, we can write the arrival time of a pathogen to
location a as [89]

Ta

=

deff
(β,

(P)
R0

,γ,ε)

Veff

(10. 32)

Therefore the arrival time is the ratio of the effective distance deff and an effective speed Veff.
The effective speed is determined only by the epidemiological parameters of the pathogen,
whereas the effective distance deff depends only on the topology of the mobility network
encoded by pij. When confronted with a new outbreak, the pathogen-specific epidemiological
parameters are unknown in the beginning. However, (10.32) predicts that the relative arrival

i.e. the ratio depends only on the effective distances. Therefore, the relative arrival times of the
disease depend only on the topology of the mobility network. As the mobility patterns around
the world are unique and model-independent, the predictions of different models converge,
independent of the choice of the epidemiological parameters.

infections are shown as red nodes. Each panel compares the state of the system in the conventional
geographic representation (bottom) with the effective distance representation (top). The complex
spatial pattern observed in the geographic representation becomes a circular wave that moves outwards
at constant speed in the effective distance representation (see also the Online Resource 10.6). After
[89].

In summary, joint advances in data collection and network epidemics have offered the capability
to predict the real-time spread of a pathogen. The developed models can help design response
and mitigation scenarios, train health and emergency personnel, can be used to explore the
impact of various interventions, from quarantine to travel restrictions, and to optimize the
deployment of treatments and vaccines.

Interestingly, the recent success of epidemic forecast is not due to the improved understanding
of the underlying biology of infectious pathogens. It can be attributed instead to the lucky
situation that when it comes to the spreading of a pathogen, the epidemic parameters are of
secondary importance. The most important factor is the structure of the mobility network. That,
however, can be accurately estimated from travel schedules, allowing us to turn human mobility

Epidemic Sources
Finding the source of an epidemic is like ﬁnding the source of a water ripple. As pathogens do not
spread in a uniform medium, the challenge is to identify the appropriate “ripples” in the mobility
network.

  

Identifying the source of an epidemic is an important component of epidemic control. The
source could be the first individual in a contact network, or the city where the pathogen
first emerged in the mobility network. The mathematical formulation of the problem [91]
inspired a burst of research on the subject [92-99].

The difficulty in finding the source is rooted in the stochastic nature of the infection
process: different initial conditions can lead to similar infection patterns at the
observation time. The approach we take depends on the information we have about the
epidemic:

• In the simplest case at a given moment t we know the nodes that have been infected and
the network on which the pathogen spreads. The task is to find the source i [91] (Image
10.33).
• If we also have the time of infection for each node, we can reconstruct the dynamics of
the epidemic, significantly enhancing our ability to detect the source.
• The best strategy is to monitor the hubs, as they have the earliest and the most accurate
information about a breakout. For example, for a pathogen spreading on a scale-free
network, monitoring the state of 18% of the highest degree nodes can offer a 90% success
rate in detecting the source. In contrast, to achieve the same level of accuracy we need to
monitor 41% of the nodes if we select randomly the nodes we monitor [93].
• In the effective distance representation (Image 10.31) the infection follows a circular
pattern only if we use the right outbreak location. Otherwise the observed pattern is
asymmetric. Therefore, we can detect the source by finding the location (node) from
which the outbreak pattern shows the highest radial symmetry [89].

Section 10.8

Summary

Most networks facilitate transfer along their links: transfer of trust, knowledge, habits or
information (social networks), electricity (power grid), money (financial networks), goods (trade
networks). To understand these phenomena, we must understand how the network topology
affects these dynamical processes. In this chapter we focused on the spread of pathogens along
the links of the network, the area where our understanding of the interplay between dynamical
phenomena and network topology is the most advanced. We showed that the network topology

Modeling the spread of pathogens also represents an important practical application of network
science. The advances in this area were rather spectacular, giving birth to accurate epidemic
forecasts, something that was only a dream a decade earlier. Two advances made this possible.
The first is the emergence of a robust theoretical framework to describe network-based
epidemics. The second is access to accurate real time data on human travel and demographics,
allowing us to reconstruct the mobility network that is responsible for the global spread of a
pathogen. As we have seen in SECTION 10.7, the biological parameters and the network
contributions to the accuracy of the observed predictive power are decoupled. Consequently, an
accurate forecast requires primarily an accurate knowledge of the mobility network.

The analytical framework of network epidemics has offered a number of unexpected results, the
most important being the vanishing characteristic spreading time and epidemic threshold in
heterogeneous networks. As most contact networks encountered in epidemic processes have a
broad degree distribution, these results are of immediate and of lasting theoretical and practical
interest.

Equally important are the insights network epidemiology offers for immunization strategies. As
we showed in SECTION 10.6, while random immunization can successfully eradicate a virus that
spreads on a random network, this strategy is suboptimal in a scale-free network. As most
contact networks are heterogenous, this is a rather depressing conclusion. Yet, we showed that
selective immunization strategies can restore the epidemic threshold and suppress the
prevalence of a pathogen. Selective immuniztion succeeds by systematically altering the
topology of the network on which a pathogen spreads.

Epidemic phenomena became a central topic in network science after Romualdo Pastor-

real-time predictions for the spread of a pathogen.

Deriving the Epidemic Equation
Network Science
by Albert-László Barabási
We start by deriving the continuum model (10.3) from the microscopic processes that describe
the interactions between two individuals [101]. Consider a susceptible individual in contact with
an infected individual, so that the susceptible individual becomes infected with probability βdt
during the time interval dt. The probability that the susceptible individual is not infected in the
dt interval is (1– βdt). If the susceptible individual i has degree ki, each of its ki links could in
principle infect it. Therefore the probability that it avoids infection is (1– βdt)ki. Finally the total
probability that node i becomes infected in time dt is 1– (1– βdt)ki, or one minus the total

probability that it is not infected. Assuming βdt ≪ 1, at the leading order the probability that a

  

susceptible individual becomes infected is

ki

1 − (1 − βdt) ≈ β dt
In a random network all nodes have approximately 〈k〉 neighbors. Replacing ki with 〈k〉 in (10.33)
we obtain the first term of the continuum equation (10.3). If we do not replace ki with 〈k〉, we
obtain to the first term of (10.13), capturing the spread of a pathogen in a heterogenous network

(10. 33)

Epidemic Threshold and Network Topology

A key result of SECTION 10.3 connects the network topology to the epidemic threshold λc, a
result derived using the continuum theory. We can arrive at the same result using a mechanistic
argument that illustrates the connection between the epidemic threshold and the network
topology.

Consider a pathogen that is transmitted with probability β in a unit time. Therefore in a unit
time an infected node with degree k will infect βk neighbors. If each infected node recovers at
rate µ, then the characteristic time that a node stays infected is 1/µ. The pathogen can persist in
the population only if during this 1/µ time interval the infected node infects at least one other
node. Otherwise, the pathogen gradually dies out.

In other words, if βk/µ < 1, then our degree-k node recovers before it could infect other nodes. If
we consider a random network, where most nodes have comparable degrees, k~〈k〉, the condition
βk/µ=1 allows us to calculate the epidemic threshold. Using λ= β/µ we obtain λc =1/〈k〉, which is
the high-k limit of the result (10.25) derived for random networks. It tells us that the ability of a
pathogen to spread is determined by the interplay between the epidemiological characteristics
of the pathogen (β and µ) and the network topology (〈k〉).

In a scale-free network nodes have widely different degrees. Therefore while the network’s
average degree may satisfy β〈k〉/µ < 1, suggesting that the virus will die out, for all nodes with k >
〈k〉 we have βk/µ > 1. If such a high degree node is infected, even if the spreading rate λ is under
the threshold 1/〈k〉, the disease can spread, persisting in the hubs. This is the reason why the

In this section we solve the SI, SIS and SIR models on a network, deriving the results

threshold λc for each model.

The Density Function

The density function Θk provides the fraction of infected nodes in the neighborhood of a
susceptible node with degree k. As discussed in SECTION 10.3, to calculate ik, we must first
determine Θk. If a network lacks degree correlations, the probability that a link points from a
node with degree k to a node with degree k' is independent of k. Hence the probability that a
randomly chosen link points to a node with degree k' is the excess degree (7.3),

In this section we derive the epidemic threshold for the SIS and SIR models on scale-free
networks under hub immunization. We start with an uncorrelated network with power law
degree distribution pk=c.k-γ where c≈(γ–1)/kmin
for the critical spreading rate,

-γ+1 and k ≥ kmin. In SECTION 10.16 we obtained

Under hub immunization we immunize all nodes whose degree is larger than k0. From the
perspective of the epidemic this is equivalent with removing the high degree nodes from the
network. Therefore to calculate the new critical spreading rate, we need to determine the
average degree 〈k'〉 and the second moment 〈k'2〉 after the hubs have been removed. This
problem was addressed in the ADVANCED TOPICS 8.F, where we studied the robustness of a
network under attack. We have seen that hub removal has two effects:

•  The maximum degree of the network changes to k0.
•  The links connected to the removed hubs are also removed, as if we randomly remove an

The SIR Model and Bond Percolation

The SIR model is a dynamical model that captures the time dependent spread of an infection in a
network. Yet, it can be mapped into a static bond percolation problem [103-106]. This mapping
offers analytical tools that help us predict the model’s behavior.

Consider an epidemic process on a network, so that each infected node transmits a pathogen to
each of its neighbors with rate β, and recovers after a recovery time τ=1/µ. We view the infection
as a Poisson process, consisting of series of random contacts with average interevent time βτ.
Therefore the probability that an infected node does not transmit the pathogen to susceptible

recovers in τ=1/µ time. Therefore the overall probability that the pathogen is passed on is 1–e–βτ.
by Albert-László Barabási

This process is equivalent with bond percolation on the same network, where each directed link
is occupied with probability pb=1–e–βτ (Image 10.35). If β and τ are the same for each node, the
network can be considered undirected. Although this mapping looses the temporal dynamics of
the epidemic process, it has several advantages:

•  The total fraction of infected nodes in the endemic state maps into the size of the giant
component of the percolation problem.
•  The probability that a pathogen dies out before reaching the endemic state equals the fraction
of the nodes in a randomly selected finite component in the percolation problem.
•  We can determine the epidemic threshold by exploiting the known properties of bond
percolation. Consider the average number of links outgoing from a node that can be reached by a
link. This allows us to retrace the course of the epidemic: If an infected individual infects on
average at least one other individual, then the epidemic can reach an endemic state. Since a
node can be reached by one of its k links, the probability to be reached is kpk/N〈k〉. The
probability of each of its k–1 outgoing links infecting its neighbor is pb.

Mapping Epidemics into Percolation
Network Science
Consider the contact network on which the epidemic spreads. To map the spreading process into
by Albert-László Barabási
percolation, we leave in place each link with probability, pb=1–e–β/μ, a probability determined by the
biological characteristics of the pathogen. Therefore links are removed with probability e–β/μ. The
cluster size distribution of the remaining network can be mapped exactly into the outbreak size. For
large β/μ we will likely have a giant component, indicating that we could face a global outbreak. β/μ
corresponds to a virus that has difﬁculty spreading and we end up with numerous small clusters,
indicating that the pathogen will likely die out.

Since the network is randomly connected, as long as the epidemic has not spread yet, the
average number of neighbors infected by the selected node is

Equation (10.62) agrees with the result (10.46) derived earlier from the dynamical models:
Scale-free networks with γ ≤ 3 have a divergent second moment, hence such networks undergo a
percolation transition even at pb→0. That is, a virus can spread on this network regardless of
how small is the infection probability β or how small is the recovery time τ.
